shit!\"\" moment on iran  by  dave lindorff | march 12 2008 - 8:18am  everyhorrormovie has that \"\"oh shit!\"\" moment when the hero or heroes arehuddled insome creepy hideout and suddenly something happens thattells you thatthe monster is just around the corner or just about toattack. in\"\"jurassic park\"\" it was the pulsing ripples in a cup ofwater heraldingthe arrival of a t-rex. in \"\"jaws\"\" it was the deep bassmusic lettingyou know that a monstrous shark was about to attack. wellwe justgot our \"\"oh shit!\"\" moment with the just-announced resignationof admiralwilliam j. fallon the military commander of us middle eastoperations. adm.fallon 63 famously said that an attack oniran would not happen \"\"on mywatch\"\" and is widely believed to havealready threatened along with anumber of other top generals andadmirals to quit the service if thebush administration were to launchan air attack on iran. put thepieces together. we know that thevice president is obsessed with adesire to attack iran and has beensince before he even took office.bush has repeatedly stressed thatiran cannot be permitted to continuewith its nuclear processing (hecalls it their \"\"nukular\"\" bomb programthough there is no evidence thatthe country has a nuclear bombdevelopment program and in fact thelast national intelligence estimateon iran said there was not andhadn\\'t been since 2003). and fallon hasnow quit. the eisenhowernuclear aircraft carrier strike forcehas departed for stationing offiran joining forces already in placethere and loaded to the brimwith strike aircraft tomahawk missilesand even nuclear weapons. itwas long ago reported that stealth bombershad been put in place income of the countries of the old soviet unionnorth of iran as well ason the island of diego garcia in the indianocean. all theelements that is to say are in place for amassive air assault oniranian targets designed to destroy its nuclearprogram cripple itsmilitary command and control and--at least this isa stated cheneygoal--to lead to the overthrow of the iranian governmentby its ownpeople. it is of course the strategy of madmen. theushas no forces to send into iran. all they can do is bomb it.andbombing a country doesn\\'t lead its people to rise up. it leads themtorally \\'round the flag. especially when the civilian casualties ofournot-so-\"\"smart\"\" bombs start to soar. if such an attack weretohappen we can kiss goodbye to six years of domestic peace suchaswe\\'ve had. the iranians have considerable capability to inflictdamageon us targets of interest both overseas and here in the domesticususing assymetrical warfare techniques. the worse part is they\\'dbecompletely justified in doing so since any attack on them would beacrime against peace--the gravest of all international crimes. americantroopsalready mired and pinned down in a war in iraq would findthemselvessuddenly under attack by shia forces there who for severalyears nowhave been largely leaving them alone. and oil whichjust bumpedup against $110 a barrel an all-time record will doublein priceovernight as the whole persian gulf becomes a war zone. wecanexpect massive launches of small boats armed with missilesandtorpedoes as well as sophisticated anti-ship missiles fromshorebatteries all fired at us ships in the gulf and it wouldbeastounding if some or even many vessels of the us fleet weren\\'t sunk. meanwhiletankertraffic in the gulf which accounts for 20% or more of theworld\\'s oilwill cease as insurance rates for those vessels goesthrough the roof. themonster of war will be unleashed and willnot easily be defeated.that\\'s why adm. fallon was so opposed to thewhole idea. he knows thatit will be a disaster for the us militarilyeconomically andpolitically. the worst part is that cheneyknows this too. hejust doesn\\'t care. this is the man\\'s parting shotas he leavesoffice--to put the country into the throes of a war sovicious that noone will think of pursuing him for his long list ofcrimes against thenation and the constitution. he isguessing--and he may beright--that the american public willsheep-like as always rally to thecause with a new round

       " ' then why in fucking hell do we have republican controlled supreme court which can influence who becomes president only if their is a tie in the presidential election as well as the fact that our free market is completely owned by big business. gentleman and ladies if this country was so great we would not have a 9 trillion dollar debt a failing dollar a failing economy and we would be a free nation except the patriot act rfid act and rendition among other violations have hinder this free nation. if we are so free then why do we have rendition to take suspected or compltely innocent americans and locked them up and torture them in till the confessed to a crime they did not commit. this is the only beginning yet in mind is signals the end of the end as our nation is fixing to collaspe just like the roman empire.no country is completely \"\"free\"\" that word shouldn\\'t even exist.ok finally someone with logic. to me socialism is better because you are born and you automatically know what the government and your place in your country. in capitalism when you are born your are fed lies or so be called truths which can remain true in till someone like bush gets into office and changes those so called truths. socialism only needs to be fair to the people to stay in controll. capitalism needs a police force to monitor and to protect the free market so that no one gain absolute power over it. i think that is fair to say.you are from russia. i think i want to move there one day. why live in a country that is changing from freedom to fascism. why not live in a country where you know your place.you for or against companies moving offshore? how about illegals working for a company? just curiousi believe a company has a right to make money; however go over seas for cheap labor is wrong. if it cost more to make your products blame the gov. for inflation then take action to lower costs by being innovated. to me thats sounds at least fair. illegal immigrants not wanted. no help is wanted. if you want a job then apply for a work vista. do not cheat yourself or life.the following are the justices on the supreme court and which president nominated them:  chief justice john roberts - george w. bush (considered to be more on the conservative end) associate justice john paul stevens - gerald ford (considered to be one of the more liberal members on the court) associate justice antonin scalia - ronald reagan (considered to be the most conservative on the court) associate justice anthony kennedy - ronald reagan (most moderate on the bench) associate justice david souter - george h.w. bush (votes with the liberal wing) associate justice clarence thomas - george h.w. bush (votes with the conservative wing) associate justice ruth bader ginsburg - bill clinton (one of the more liberal voting justices) associate justice stephen breyer - bill clinton (votes with the liberal wing) associate justice samuel alito - george w. bush (considered to be more conservative)  essentially this is still a split court. you have 4 conservatives (roberts scalia thomas and alito) and 4 liberals (stevens souter ginsburg and breyer).  and then you have the swing vote in kennedy.  now please explain to me how this supreme court is a \"\"republican controlled supreme court.\"\"ok batman you make a good point. so before i leave the country what can we do to keep free market fix the economy fix the dollar and over all fix mother liberty. what is the solution.back in 2000 it was a republican controlled supreme court which of course changes from time to time. but still the point has been made. why does a suprem power possibly influened by one party or the other party make and decide who is to be in charge of our country. why not a re-vote or a boxing match. or something.k. now here is my stance on it all. i think if 1 is legal the other has to be. simply because they are the same thing in concept: cheap labor for an advantage in a market less input for the same output. i\\'m not necessarily for both but i do think that if companies can go offshore then companies who can\\'t afford to (despite the industry) should be able to higher cheap labor.  the problem with socialism is that government controlling wages will lead to lack of effort because of the lack of benefits. right now people work hard and continue to work hard to work their way up that ladder with socialism you don\\'t get the same kind of purpose or drive from the workers. what we have now isn\\'t a real capitalism because no matter what the gov\\'t still watches for monopolies and still regulates a base point in wages (minimum wages).  i would prefer a capitalistic market over a socialistic market any day of the week because it benefits the hard working man who strives to climb the ladder.\"\\n',\n",

       " ' this is still a split court. you have 4 conservatives (roberts scalia thomas and alito) and 4 liberals (stevens souter ginsburg and breyer).  and then you have the swing vote in kennedy.  now please explain to me how this supreme court is a \"\"republican controlled supreme court.\"\"ok batman you make a good point. so before i leave the country what can we do to keep free market fix the economy fix the dollar and over all fix mother liberty. what is the solution.back in 2000 it was a republican controlled supreme court which of course changes from time to time. but still the point has been made. why does a suprem power possibly influened by one party or the other party make and decide who is to be in charge of our country. why not a re-vote or a boxing match. or something.k. now here is my stance on it all. i think if 1 is legal the other has to be. simply because they are the same thing in concept: cheap labor for an advantage in a market less input for the same output. i\\'m not necessarily for both but i do think that if companies can go offshore then companies who can\\'t afford to (despite the industry) should be able to higher cheap labor.  the problem with socialism is that government controlling wages will lead to lack of effort because of the lack of benefits. right now people work hard and continue to work hard to work their way up that ladder with socialism you don\\'t get the same kind of purpose or drive from the workers. what we have now isn\\'t a real capitalism because no matter what the gov\\'t still watches for monopolies and still regulates a base point in wages (minimum wages).  i would prefer a capitalistic market over a socialistic market any day of the week because it benefits the hard working man who strives to climb the ladder.hell if i knew then i would do something. i do not know. i do not know what to do in life. i just want to be free. not haveing to be enslaved or watch our mother liberyt by raped dried by those child-raping politicians who are destroying our beloved nation. what can we do?how do you know my name? that is not listed. i do not even have it anywhere on thiis computer or my email address. holy shit you are from the government.the supreme court is completely independent and was designed that way. the only time that any partisanship has an influence is when the confirmations are taking place.  so tell me how exactly can any president party or politician have any influence over a member in the supreme court? what can they do? the justice is nominated for life. what could any party or politician possibly offer to a sitting supreme court justice when that justice has a guaranteed job no matter who\\'s in power and no matter what their decision is?  think about the 2000 election for a second. what did the justices who voted to stop the recount (let\\'s remember that the case wasn\\'t about the supreme court voting for one candidate or another....if you really think that please reread the decision) have to gain from doing so? what motive could justice scalia and then chief justice rehnquist possibly have in ensuring that one party or another or one president or another came to power? do you know what would have happened to all the sitting \"\"conservative\"\" justices if gore had won instead? nothing. so how did the party have any influence over their decision?to seth: i looked up the 2000 supreme court judges and most of them were placed on the bench by republican presidents meaning that they swung towards bush. now the bench has some new people. but all in all one still must be weary of such a system. a system that can almost if given the power to do so or by themselves with the protection of the military decide who can live or die in this country by simple declarations. it is complicated. not one government or political system is perfect. i understand that.my point is my country is not perfect but is going to rapidly change in the blink of an eye and freedom here will die. and i am not too sure how to live life anymore? i sent you a message to your myspace page on a private matter. that will help clear my mind in what i want to do in life. because i am not too sure on how to live life or what too do.batman: yeah saint michael is my pic. you scared me there for a moment. i do not mind living such a simple life. i have though about it. but i have feel that i meant to live for so much more. how can one achieve when all the odds and your own country is stacked against you. i am trying my god i am trying yet i still have not reached the promised land. eventually i will find peace within my mind i do hope so.\"\\n',\n",

forced sterilizations was provided by so-called eugenics laws. most compulsory sterilizations occurred in the 1930s and \\'40s but some states such as virginia continued the practice until the late

eugenics movement in the usa it is not widely known that there was a strong eugenics movement not only in germany but in the usa as well. the doctrine hatched in the second half of the 19th century combined elements of social darwinism with the mendelian theory of heredity. its advocates pushed for perfecting the human \"\"gene pool\"\" by influencing the reproductive process. their ongoing attempts at achieving a \"\"perfect\"\" society included aggressive - and in the case of the nazis murderous - actions against marginal groups and minorities.  american scientists played a vanguard role in the eugenics movement which also had its supporters in scandinavia latin america and japan. u.s. biologists like charles b. davenport and harry h. laughlin advocated keeping the \"\"anglo-american race\"\" pure. their premise was that most ailments as well as such social problems as poverty and criminality were hereditary in nature. therefore persons with a \"\"good genetic makeup\"\" should be encouraged to have families while \"\"inferior\"\" people of allegedly poor genetic stock should be prevented from reproducing. among those people regarded as inferior were epileptics manic-depressives prostitutes alcoholics the homeless and criminals. under the eugenics laws people who came to the negative attention of the social authorities could be branded as \"\"feeble-minded\"\" by court order and legally forced to undergo steriliziation. a model for the nazis by the early 1930s some 30 american states had adopted eugenics laws. most of them were modeled after the law which harry h. laughlin had drafted for the state of virginia in 1924. that legislation found emulators outside the united states too. for example it served germany\\'s national socialists as a model for their 1933 \"\"law for protection against genetically defective offspring\"\" on the basis of which at least 400000 men and women were forcibly sterilized. more than 200000 handicapped or allegedly handicapped people were also murdered by the nazis. the university of heidelberg was apparently so grateful to eugenicist laughlin that it awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1936 for his \"\"services on behalf of racial hygiene.\"\"  in 1927 the u.s. supreme court affirmed the constitutionality of virginia\\'s sterilization law. this was followed by a swift rise in the number of forced sterilizations in the united states. american eugenicists also pushed for anti-immigration measures and stricter laws to prevent racially mixed marriages. in a speech to the u.s. congress laughlin had argued that \"\"morally and intellectually inferior\"\" immigrants from eastern and southern europe were polluting america\\'s genetic potential. the 1924 immigration restriction

and bioethics at the university of virginia. a strong eugenics movement in the usa it is not widely known that there was a strong eugenics movement not only in germany but in the usa as well. the doctrine hatched in the second half of the 19th century combined elements of social darwinism with the mendelian theory of heredity. its advocates pushed for perfecting the human \"\"gene pool\"\" by influencing the reproductive process. their ongoing attempts at achieving a \"\"perfect\"\" society included aggressive - and in the case of the nazis murderous - actions against marginal groups and minorities.  american scientists played a vanguard role in the eugenics movement which also had its supporters in scandinavia latin america and japan. u.s. biologists like charles b. davenport and harry h. laughlin advocated keeping the \"\"anglo-american race\"\" pure. their premise was that most ailments as well as such social problems as poverty and criminality were hereditary in nature. therefore persons with a \"\"good genetic makeup\"\" should be encouraged to have families while \"\"inferior\"\" people of allegedly poor genetic stock should be prevented from reproducing. among those people regarded as inferior were epileptics manic-depressives prostitutes alcoholics the homeless and criminals. under the eugenics laws people who came to the negative attention of the social authorities could be branded as \"\"feeble-minded\"\" by court order and legally forced to undergo steriliziation. a model for the nazis by the early 1930s some 30 american states had adopted eugenics laws. most of them were modeled after the law which harry h. laughlin had drafted for the state of virginia in 1924. that legislation found emulators outside the united states too. for example it served germany\\'s national socialists as a model for their 1933 \"\"law for protection against genetically defective offspring\"\" on the basis of which at least 400000 men and women were forcibly sterilized. more than 200000 handicapped or allegedly handicapped people were also murdered by the nazis. the university of heidelberg was apparently so grateful to eugenicist laughlin that it awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1936 for his \"\"services on behalf of racial hygiene.\"\"  in 1927 the u.s. supreme court affirmed the constitutionality of virginia\\'s sterilization law. this was followed by a swift rise in the number of forced sterilizations in the united states. american eugenicists also pushed for anti-immigration measures and stricter laws to prevent racially mixed marriages. in a speech to the u.s. congress laughlin had argued that \"\"morally and intellectually inferior\"\" immigrants from eastern and southern europe were polluting america\\'s genetic potential. the 1924 immigration restriction act reduced by two thirds the immigration quotas for people from those parts of europe. in signing the new law president calvin coolidge said: \"\"america must remain american.\"\" pseudo-science at universities for a time the doctrine of eugenics exerted considerable influence on american society. based largely on political and social prejudices the pseudo-science was taught at schools and universities. leading institutions such as harvard cornell and columbia offered courses in eugenics. prominent industrialists like cornflakes magnate j. h. kellogg supported the creation of eugenics groups and organizations. so-called fitter family contests were held at country fairs with citizens parading their \"\"good genes.\"\" movies like \"\"the black stork\"\" propagated eugenic sterilization.  during the 1940s however the theory of eugenics came under increasing criticism because of its racial prejudices and its lack of scientific foundation. most american sterilization laws were abandoned during the 1950s. in 1980 former psychiatric patients who had been forced into sterilization banded together for a class-action suit demanding compensation from the state of virginia. but a federal judge rejected their suit on the grounds that the u.s. supreme court had affirmed the constitutionality of sterilization back in 1927. that supreme court ruling was never fought even in subsequent years. as a result future damage claims have little prospect of success. and the victims of eugenic forced sterilization have no lobbying

[if you\\'re reading this story because of a link from the huffpost or fark.com i\\'ve updated my reporting here. it looks like clinton did rake in $10m as of sometime late yesterday based on a claimed total of 100000 donations since tuesday night.}\"\\n',\n",
       " ' syria link (11:50 min.)  bush administration opens up about israeli airstrike on syrian reactor washington (cbs news) \\x95 the white house said thursday that north korea\\'s secret work on anuclear reactor with syria was \"\"a dangerous and potentiallydestabilizing development for the world\"\" raising doubts aboutpyongyang\\'s intention to carry through with a promised disclosure ofits nuclear activities.  sevenmonths after israel bombed the reactor the white house broke itssilence and said north korea assisted syria\\'s secret nuclear programand that the destroyed facility was not intended for \"\"peacefulpurposes.\"\"  the disclosure could undermine six-party negotiationsto try to resolve the nuclear standoff with north korea. the whitehouse issued a two-page statement after lawmakers were given detailsabout the reactor in a series of briefings on capitol hill. the whitehouse said the international atomic energy agency also was beingbriefed on the intelligence.  while calling north korea\\'s nuclearassistance to syria a \"\"dangerous manifestation\"\" of pyongyang\\'s nuclearweapons program and its proliferation activities the u.s. said itremained committed to the talks.  the administration said that after the reactor was damaged beyond repair syria tried to bury evidence of its existence.  \"\"thiscover-up only served to reinforce our confidence that this reactor wasnot intended for peaceful activities\"\" white house press secretary danaperino said. \"\"the syrian regime must come clean before the worldregarding its illicit nuclear activities.\"\"  cia director michaelhayden director of national intelligence mike mcconnell and nationalsecurity adviser stephen hadley briefed lawmakers who were shown avideo presentation of intelligence information that the administrationcontends establishes a strong link between north korea\\'s nuclearprogram and the bombed syrian site. it included still photographs thatshowed a strong resemblance between specific features of the plant andthe one near yongbyon.  according to officials familiar with thepresentation it did not show moving images inside the facility or anynorth korean workers but included photographs that depict similaritiesbetween the north korean and syrian reactor designs.  u.s.negotiators have been trying hard to close a deal in which north koreawould admit to and give up all its nuclear activities in return forbeing taken off the list of countries that support terrorism reportscbs news national security correspondent david martin.  but atthe same time the administration had all the photos showing northkorea was secretly helping syria build a reactor that could produceplutonium for nuclear weapons adds martin. the images include a photothat u.s. intelligence says shows the head of syria\\'s nuclear agencywith one of the north koreans who was negotiating with the unitedstates.  by making the photos public martin reports the u.s. istelling north korea: \"\"if you won\\'t come clean we\\'ll come clean foryou.\"\"  the syrian nuclear reactor destroyed by israeli jets waswithin weeks or months of being functional a top u.s. official toldthe associated press speaking on condition of anonymity because of thesensitivity of the matter. the official said the facility was mostlycompleted but still needed significant testing before it could bedeclared operational.  no uranium which is needed to fuel areactor was evident at the site a remote area of eastern syria alongthe euphrates river. but the u.s. official said the reactor was similarin design to a north korean reactor at yongbyon which has in the pastproduced small amounts of plutonium the marterial needed to makepowerful nuclear weapons.  top members of the house intelligencecommittee said the reactor posed a serious threat of spreadingdangerous nuclear materials.  \"\"this is a serious proliferationissue both for the middle east and the countries that may be involvedin asia\"\" said rep. pete hoekstra r-mich.  hoekstra andintelligence committee chairman silvestre reyes d-texas toldreporters after the closed meeting that they were angry that the bushadministration had delayed briefing the full committee for eight months.  \"\"it\\'sbad management and terrible public policy to go for eight monthsknowing this was out there and then drop this in our laps six hoursbefore they go to the public\"\" hoekstra said.  president bush\\'sfailure to keep congress informed has created friction that may imperilcongressional support for bush\\'s policies toward north korea and syriahe said.  \"\"it totally breaks down any trust that you have betweenthe administration and congress\"\" hoekstra said. \"\"i think it reallyjeopardizes any type of the agreement they may come up with\"\" regardingnorth korea.  a senior administration said the white house wentpublc with the evidence now to prevent an even broader confrontation inthe middle east region reports cbs news white house correspondent markknoller.  \"\"we feared that if knowledge of this event spread quickly syria might feel greater pressure to react\"\" the official said.  the white house also stressed that north korea\\'s assistance on the syrian reactor was an issue of \"\"great international concern.\"\"  \"\"theconstruction of this reactor was a dangerous and potentiallydestabilizing development for the region and the world\"\" perino said inthe statement. \"\"this is particularly true because it was done covertlyand in violation of the very procedures designed to reassure the worldof the peaceful intent of nuclear activities.  \"\"the united statescalls upon the international community to redouble our common effortsto ending these activities and preventing the spread of weapons of massdestruction in this critical region.\"\"you mean like north korea \"\"came clean\"\"?why come clean iraq came clean with inspectors and they submitted every bit of evidence with a 1000 pages that it was not in pocession of wmds yet it was meaningless in the goal to invade the sovereign nation anyway. this come clean nonsense is all political rhedoric to appease stupid people who support policies of an aggressive preemtive nature and dont want the truth.i think the white house need to \"\"come clean\"\" about nukes first.pete:  i have had discussions with one of the iraqi inspectors - who is fluent in arabic. he is fluent enough that he gets paid to do translations. he is also a friend of a close friend.  he said that iraq did have wmd\\'s that they hid information that they had spies int he inspection teams that they knew when the inspectors were coming. inspectors would be held up at one gate and could watch convoys of trucks leave at another gate.  the truth in syria is that north korea was working with syria to build nukes - in contravention of their agreement with the u.s. not to do so in return for fuel supplies. that agreement was worked out by one jimmy carter under the auspices of the clinton administration. the north koreans later admitted that they violated the treaty from the very beginning.\"\\n',\n",

       " ' 5:00 pm et    ottawa (reuters) - u.s. soldiers who have deserted the military because of the war in iraq should be allowed to stay permanently in canada the house of commons voted in a nonbinding motion on tuesday.  advertisement  the three opposition parties which together hold a majority of seats in the house backed a motion that said the government should allow conscientious objectors and their families \"\"who have refused or left military service related to a war not sanctioned by the united nations\"\" to stay in canada.  canada was a haven for tens of thousands of draft dodgers during the vietnam war and has attracted an estimated 175 to 200 americans who are resisting the iraq conflict.  \"\"i think canada has always been a place which has welcomed those who seek peace and seek freedom\"\" bob rae foreign affairs spokesman for the main opposition liberal party told reporters outside the commons after the vote.  the minority conservative government opposes the idea arguing that unlike during the vietnam war the current u.s. military is composed of volunteers and also that washington allows people to apply for conscientious objector status.  \"\"people do not join with their eyes closed. if they do then they have their own problems\"\" conservative member of parliament laurie hawn a retired lieutenant colonel in the canadian air force said during debate on the motion.  the supreme court of canada refused last november to hear appeals of two u.s. deserters whose applications for refugee status had been turned down by immigration authorities.

       " ' 15 minutes ago  madrid (afp) - two truck drivers were killed on picket lines in spain and portugal on tuesday as strikes by hauliers over soaring fuel prices turned increasingly ugly.    spanish police escorted petrol tankers into barcelona as the stoppage launched monday caused food and fuel shortages and huge tailbacks on the spanish-french border. french railway workers began their own walkout increasing the transport chaos. a portuguese driver was killed after he was hit by a truck as he manned a barricade filtering traffic near alcanena north of lisbon. a police spokesman quoted witnesses as saying the 52-year-old man climbed onto the side of a truck in a bid to stop it and fell off under the wheels lusa news agency reported. later tuesday a truck driver in southern spain was run over and killed by a van as he was working on a picket line outside a wholesale market in the southern city of granada police said. other trucks in portugal and spain have been stoned or had their windows smashed and tyres punctured for working during the national strikes. tens of thousands of truckers are on strike or joining the protests to demand government help to offset the higher fuel costs. while new talks with trucker representatives were held in madrid authorities in northern spain ordered emergency measures after many petrol stations in the catalonia region ran out of fuel. \"\"twenty tanker trucks escorted by the regional police left an industrial zone this morning for barcelona port to help supply and distribute to petrol stations in the region\"\" a regional police spokesman told afp. forty percent of petrol stations in catalonia have run out of fuel according to manuel amado president of the catalonia federation of service stations. arrivals of fresh meat fish and fruit in madrid have come to a near halt according to officials at the mercamadrid market spain\\'s biggest wholesale market. they said that fish would be in short supply from thursday but stocks of other foods should last until the end of the week. automakers in spain said most of the country\\'s automobile plants including those of nissan mercedes benz seat and renault have had to cut or halt production. auto plants are particularly vulnerable to a strike by hauliers which provide them with spare parts. truckers stopped lorries from crossing the french-spain border and caused major tailbacks around major spanish cities including madrid barcelona and valencia. spanish and french truckers staged pickets on either side of the frontier between the two countries. they blocked a bridge on the border at bidassoa in the western basque region and other main crossing points. on the french side service areas on motorways were packed with trucks from the border right back to bordeaux about 200 kilometres (125 miles) away. spain\\'s second largest hauliers\\' union fenadismer which claims to represent 70000 out of spain\\'s 380000 truck drivers launched an open-ended strike on monday. talks monday between the hauliers and the government ended in failure fenadismer said. the portuguese government said it hoped to have an agreement with its truckers by the end of the week. a separate strike by workers at the french rail company sncf severely hit rail traffic. about half of intercity and local commuter trains were running along with about three quarters of tgv high speed trains from paris to southwest france. some express commuter lines into paris were badly affected by the strike. spanish fisherman were keeping up their strike against fuel prices but most french trawlers have decided to go back to work after several weeks of blocking ports and access to oil refineries.with the food shortage the closing of the borders the massive floods in the north of spain & basque country the crisis in spain is escalating.since fuel costs about twice as much in europe as in the u.s. since oil has a world-wide price and the cost of refining is about the same everywhere the difference is taxes.  perhaps the socialist governments should reduce some fo the taxes in an aeffort to not destroy their own countries.  and if you think prices are high now just wait until iran gets their nukes working (something that i notice the leftists think they should do.)ironic latin america & europe have better relations with the arabs then americans but the price of oil is higher but its high all around now thanks to the us war in iraq & afghanistan.give it a couple of years and people will stop going to work.  because they cannot afford to.dont under-estimate public transporation (buses) & the motorcycle. the liscense & the gas for that is cheaper.i think this is a temporary problem once the government negotiates with the union it will be taken care of the lesson will be learned.i got me a little 125cc bike at the moment. i put £5 in it and it does 100 miles or so.  i use it instead of my car at the moment. the car does 100 miles on about £14.  i think the future is mopeds.better for the enviornment too.i would say that 99% of people don\\'t give two shits about the environment. if petrol was cheap i would have an american muscle car.  as it is i use my suzuki marauder to cruise about.  and that is so in america you love your big old dumb cars.\"\\n',\n",

       " ' i admit all all lawyers arent jonny cochran but still. they knowingly portray reality under a false microscope and sometimes its deadly...whats wrong with our lawyer\\'s?  there\\'s not any hanging from our trees.so very true. the language they use is pretty much foreign to probably about 90% of us. therefore making us equal in the eyes of the law pretty much a out and out lie. of course ignorance is no excuse as they say. what gets me is your considered ignorant if your unable to lawyerspeak or speak the tongue of deception.  i\\'ve had recent dealings needing a lawyer that son o bitch ripped me off more than the people i was after. he\\'s 3g\\'s richer and i\\'m in the exact same situation i was in before he was retained.  i should have handled it the old irish way but on the advice of those closest to me i refrained.  heh maybe i will send that thiefing som bitch a piece of rope and one of those witty irish quotes and let him think about that not everyone he screw\\'s is going to let it slide or maybe one day he will turn around and there i\\'ll be to explain to him about honesty and integrity and when someone charges $300.00 bucks an hour he damn well better earn it.lawyers are the biggest scumbags to live on this planet all they care about is there f---ing money they dont care if you go to prison. why do yuu think most of the people in prison are poor most of them should be in there but it makes you wonder how many innocent people are there just because the scumbag piece of crap didnt get enuogh money to line his pocket! then the lump of bile when theyve thoroughly screwed there fellow americans out of everything they have they somehow think that they are now worthy of representing us as senetor or congressman. we dont really even get a choice because chances are both sides of the race are going to be scumbag bile. so thats why we end up with a congress that has the the worst approvel rating in american history. most scumbag lawyers think they are so supperior to the average american that they have no idea what issues are most important to the people they are supposed to be representing. but they do know how to spend tax money that doesnt belong to them did i mention i hate lawyers!!!!i heard of one \"\"public defender\"\" even showing up drunk for a trial! he was do drunk that the judge had to suspend proceedings. really wonder why these people conduct themselves and treat their indigent clients the way they do.lmao  funny thing is we all hate lawyers till we need one.noneyeah but very few can afford one unless you have the wealth and fame of victor newman or bill gates!you mean a good lawyer right?  i got my older brother. he\\'s an attorney. although it would have to deal with real estate. otherwise i\\'m fucked.\"\\n',\n",
