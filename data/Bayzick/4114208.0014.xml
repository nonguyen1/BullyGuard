 <body>Ok here is the summary: Obama is the beginning of the end. McCain will just do as Bush is. Either way we are screwed. I mean Obama said he will visit all 57 states. (Muslim States) And McCain is senile and will probably die in a year.</body>

 <body> It says that you are a 104 year old female, What I mean is I graduated in the early 80s and it was a short time after that, PCs were introduced into my school most people my age either learned about computers because of there job or they learned because they wanted to on there own. For me it was a little of both. I cant imagine why a person wouldnt want to learn how to use a PC in this day and age but apparently Mccain chose not to.Mccain has been a senator for many years and his lack of computer skills has not hampered his elections to this point and I dont think it will hamper his presidentual bid. The issues are more important than whether he know how to operate a PC. But I do understand what you are saying.</body>

 <body> Maybe they refuse to use it, I wont use it simply because if there is a live human that probably needs a job one Isle down, I will go to them. If corporations had there way there wouldnt be anyone at the checkouts. So every time you use the self checkout you are sending a message arnt you.Do you get a discount on your goods when you use the self checkout?</body>

 <body>Just for perspective, or curiosity value -- when Obama has decided on his VP choice, the name of that person will be announced not only by the standard means, but simultaneously by e-mail and text.ÃÂ  Herewith:  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Dear James --  Barack Obama is about to make one of the most important decisions of this campaign -- choosing a running mate.  You have helped build this movement from the bottom up, and Barack wants you to be the first to know his choice.  Sign up today to be the first to know:  http://my.barackobama.com/vp  You will receive an email the moment Barack makes his decision, or you can text VP to 62262 to receive a text message on your mobile phone.  Once you've signed up, please forward this email to your friends, family, and coworkers to let them know about this special opportunity.  No other campaign has done this before. You can be part of this important moment.  Be the first to know who Barack selects as his running mate.  Thanks,  David  David Plouffe Campaign Manager Obama for America  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------   This is just FYI. I'm not encouraging anyone to sign on unless they're so inclined.  Of course it's a gimmick, but a neat one, and a first.</body>
