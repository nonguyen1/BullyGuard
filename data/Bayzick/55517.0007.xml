 <body>The right major... I don't care if you went to Harvard or ASU, if you major in Women's Studies you will never earn as much money as the person who got an M.D.</body>

 <body>depends on what career you want... if you want to be a doctor, the "harvard" looks good on a resume.</body>

 <body>its sooo totally both. dood...if you are a chem major...and want a good job, say in academics...you have to go to the right school. ....there are some advantages over which major one chooses to study for his or her entirety....but you all have super good points. i just know that in my field, if one has an objective, the school matters....i think its all a combination....as well as desire and drive...as someone previously stated....good luck...</body>

 <body>But even a doctor who got a degree from a state school will STILL earn plenty of money. The only thing a degree from a great school like Harvard gives you is a boost early on in the game... later, when you're older and have all this work experience behind you, the name on the degree matters less and less.</body>

 <body>I believe it's both what major and the school (just becaue of people's stereotypes). However, it's also how dedicated you are. You could have graduated from "podunk" (not a real school) but if you really put dedication into your job and show pride, you are likely to go far! People notice work ethic, mainly because so few of us have any. A little goes a long way! That's my opinion.</body>

 <body>The right major most definately. A school isn't going to put you through life, it depends on what you do and how well you do it. (Aw man that sounds real anal, but whatever)</body>
