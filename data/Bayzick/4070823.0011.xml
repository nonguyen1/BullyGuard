 <body>yeah it is a fluctuation but the fluctuations will probably result in the gas going down... I am not kidding you, they might be drilling right now and we need people to drill.</body>

 <body>  yeah everything skyrockets when we get a democratic president... back in the day of President Clinton, the taxes are high so we can spend money on government programs so the people who are working for the government gets some money. But when Bush is in there, taxes are lower because Bush is more based on consumerism and people buying stuff ourselves than paying the government for money. For the government it is good if we have higher prices, but for the regular consumers, it is bad.  yeah with the gas... the gash goes higher because instead of spending money on drilling, we spend it on more important stuff like government programs and health care and all that good stuff.</body>
