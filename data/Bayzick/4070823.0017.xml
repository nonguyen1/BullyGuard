 <body>  yeah everything skyrockets when we get a democratic president... back in the day of President Clinton, the taxes are high so we can spend money on government programs so the people who are working for the government gets some money. But when Bush is in there, taxes are lower because Bush is more based on consumerism and people buying stuff ourselves than paying the government for money. For the government it is good if we have higher prices, but for the regular consumers, it is bad.  yeah with the gas... the gash goes higher because instead of spending money on drilling, we spend it on more important stuff like government programs and health care and all that good stuff.</body>

 <body> I'm not saying you're wrong..but the gas never was a huge problem unTIL a republican so as-BUSH-was in office..we have seemed to be in debt because also too much spending on the war...so actually it looks as though the opposite happened..</body>

 <body>  You might not be saying it, but I will. Fool is wrong!  Supply side economics means suppliers make a bundle...you get screwed. "Trickle-down economics" is a lie. The only thing that trickles down is inflation. Putting more money in the hands of the rich leads them to increase their investments, bringing prices out of the reach of the lower and middle classes. Not just for gas, but also for things like housing and health care.</body>

 <body>Heres the three reasons why they've been going down this past week:  -President lifted executive ban on offshore drilling (speculation decreased) -The US is sitting down with Iran (speculation decreased) -Demand has lowered  The cost of a barrel of oil went down 18 dollars this past week, and thats not just the biggest decrease in a week since the war, thats the biggest decrease in history for one week.</body>

 <body>  i don't think you know what you're talking about   wholesale oil prices have come down to some degree  consumer prices are somewhat flexible upward, but strictly  sticky downward; so, gas prices will not fall significantly unless  the decreased demand for it, can be maintained for some time</body>
