      <body>Below are a few lines from Obama's books " his words:  From Dreams of My Father: "I ceased to advertise my mother's race at the age of 12 or 13, when I began to suspect that by doing so I was ingratiating myself to whites."  From Dreams of My Father: "I found a solace in nursing a pervasive sense of grievance and animosity against my mother's race."  From Dreams of My Father: "There was something about him that made me wary, a little too sure of himself, maybe. And white."  From Dreams of My Father: ; "It remained necessary to prove which side you were on, to show your loyalty to the black masses, to strike out and name names."  From Dreams of My Father: "I never emulate white men and brown men whose fates didn't speak to my own. It was into my father's image, the black man, son of Africa, that I'd packed all the attri butes I sought in myself, the attributes of Martin and Malcolm, Dubois and Mandela."  From Audacity of Hope: "I will stand with the Muslims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction."</body>

      <body>He was telling how he felt when he was growing up with trying to figure out was he too white, and not black enough in his early days.  For the last commet its more like he will stand by Saudi Arabia and our other Muslim ally countrys if Iran does something stupid. This could be why he wanted to talk to them at first but then released it wasnt going to do anything really. Doesnt hurt to try to talk retards.</body>

      <body>Do you honestly think President Bush and President Clinton and their appointed ones haven't tried talking to these governments? Maybe you should be reading more history books rather than biographies. LOL</body>

      <body>  Bush didn't talk to them. They're the Axis of Evil, remember? And we don't negotiate with terrorists, remember? And you can't possibly think that those quotes would win Obama votes. You can't really do much in this country without the white vote and it's not like, especially when taken out of context, those quotes really help him in any way.</body>

      <body>We don't need anyone to talk to Iran or convince them not to go nuclear. Iran is not a threat to the United States and certainly never will be, and if you believe that they are you are paranoid and out of touch with reality.</body>
