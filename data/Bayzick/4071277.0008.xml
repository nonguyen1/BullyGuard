 <body> The man had no money and lawyers don't want non-paying "indigents" for clients. This why Joe Bannano did less then 14 months in jail in his entire life.</body>

 <body>greed, acquisitiveness, grabbiness, avarice, selfish desire, avidity, covetousness, cupidity,  and those are the positive points.   However...I feel compelled to point out that unlike Medical Doctors where true skill and deication is necessary, half the shit they do a regular person could do...were not not for the US legal system itself which makes it damn near impossible for non-licensed attorney to get anywhere.</body>

 <body> Did you mentioned that these two "jokers" were "public defenders"? I wonder where "OJ" Simson would be today if his "dream team" was court appointed!!</body>

 <body>public defenders are the worst of the bunch. they don't care about the client if you are innocent they will sell you up the river. they will not show up to hearings, show up late & basically do what they can to make you look guilty when you aren't. when you are on your way to jail they will sit back & say "I tried" when laughing at you. fuckin scumbags the lot of them.</body>

 <body>  Lawyers get paid to tell lies.  Yes, I admit all all lawyers arent jonny cochran, but still. They knowingly portray reality under a false microscope, and sometimes its deadly...</body>

 <body>  So very true. The language they use is pretty much foreign to probably about 90% of us. Therefore making us equal in the eyes of the law pretty much a out and out lie. Of course ignorance is no excuse, as they say. What gets me is your considered ignorant if your unable to lawyerspeak or speak the tongue of deception.  I've had recent dealings needing a lawyer, That son o bitch ripped me off more than the people I was after. He's 3g's richer and I'm in the exact same situation I was in before he was retained.  I should have handled it the old Irish way, but on the advice of those closest to me, I refrained.  Heh, Maybe I will send that thiefing som bitch a piece of rope and one of those witty Irish quotes and let him think about that not everyone he screw's is going to let it slide, or maybe one day he will turn around and there I'll be, to explain to him about honesty and integrity and when someone charges $300.00 bucks an hour, he damn well better earn it.</body>
