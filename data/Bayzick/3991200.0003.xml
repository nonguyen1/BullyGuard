 <body>enough with the Saw's and Scary Movie sequels. Saw's aren't scary or gross and the Scary Movies havn't been funny since the 2nd one.</body>

 <body>  Shrek 4 was announced ages ago but animated movies usually take a couple of years to make so I think it comes out next year. The films have been that successful that they don't need to wait to see if the latest film does well before announcing another sequel.  Judging by the amount of sequels planned it seems that Hollywood is playing it safe.</body>

 <body>This is going to be very interesting!!  Silent Hill in my opinion was all I expected in a movie.. i have never played the games, but knew alot about the story...wonder where they are going to take this sequel!  Ace Ventura 3: oh please no!!!  The People Under The Stairs 2: wonder what made them after all these years to finally make a part 2.  The Untouchables: looking forward to this one!  Thought I heard a couple of years ago about Ghostship 2 being in post production? guess i heard wrong!</body>

 <body>every one of them a waste of film...maybe The Untouchables prequel about the rise of Capone will be good...</body>

 <body>Of those, only Toy Story 3 & Cars 2 will be worthwhile. The Untouchables? Why ruin a good thing? If it didn't work for Indiana Jones, it won't work for anything.</body>

 <body>I guess the movie industry is out of ideas. The original "Italian Job" with Michael Caine and Sir Nowell Coward is still unbeatable.</body>
