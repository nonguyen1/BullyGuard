 <body>fromthe article: "There's precedent for the federal government taking on troubled assetsfrom the private sector. In the 1930s, the Home Owners Loan Corp. wasset up to issue bonds to refinance borrowers. Then during the S&Lcrisis Congress set up the Resolution Trust Corp. to sell assets offailed banks."  Notice that history repeats itself because those who are ignorant(or too greedy) of history keep repeating it (the deregulation/lack of oversight by Republican adminstrations in the 1920s under Hoover/Coolidge, the deregulation of the 80s under Reagan/Bush, and the deregulation under Repubs in 2000s)  And it takes a Democratic admin to come in & fix it when they're voted out of office</body>

 <body>I'm not saying they shouldn't have done it completely, but it just pisses me off that there is such a double-standard. Someone can be stupid if their rich and get a bailout by the government. Someone can't be stupid and be poor, because they'll never get anything from anybody.</body>

 <body>All I know is that I am doing everything that I possibly can to vote these bastards that vote yes on the bailout bill out of office and you all should do the same! There is a double standard and there always will be until the majority of the population stands up for themselves! The government is suppose to work for US! Not vice versa! The U.S. constitution clearly states that when the government stops working for the people as a whole then the people have the right to remove that government and replace it with another one! When are we all going to stand up for what we believe? I am doing my part. I have been printing flyers with the voting records of my state congressmen (Pennsylvania) and handing them out to people! I am determined to get rid of these bastards. It is high time that they started listening to their constituents! This bailout is BULLSHIT! How about taking that $700 billion and distributing it equally among the adult population of the U.S. and everyone would receive approx. $400,000!!! Hell sounds to me like a plan! Everyone would be spending money and buying houses and there would be no need for mortgages and loans and all that other bullshit that banks do for us! Let AIG and Fanny Mae sell there desks and lamps for some cash! It is not my fault so why should I pay!</body>

 <body>   No, its our own fault, we have allowed our government to work this way, if you want someone to blame, blame yourself. When Bush wrote the Patriot Act, we should have risen up as a people and slaughtered him and everyone in the Legislative that voted yes.</body>

 <body>I don't recall a single homeowner being able to reap any benefits from this sausage laden bailout bill. Instead, the wonderful folks--the experts in lending--who gave the fools the money will be able to sell their suddenly toxic assets to the government. Granted, it's at a discount, but none of that is being passed along to those struggling to pay their mortgages.  Why do you hate people? Are these the fundamentals of our economy?</body>
