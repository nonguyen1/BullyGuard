 <body>Well the man has Schizophrenia. So he would have to teach him to never go full Schizophrenic.  What is also funny is how this year with Iron Man and Tropic Thunder under his belt people are dick riding Downey, yet I'm sure people skipped or hated all those other films he was in, like Gothika, The Shaggy Dog, Game 6. Just to name a few.</body>

 <body> Gothika was a bad movie period... Just becasue i hated that movie doesn't mean i didn't like him.. hell I hated the Happening, doesn't mean i hated Mark Walberg who will redeem himself with Max Payne.. And i did see The Shaggy Dog.  Downey has always been a good actor, it was his personal life that got in his way, and Ironman just put him in the comeback seat and he has looked back so far..</body>

 <body>  It's I Am Sam... ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER BLOODY MADE IMO.  And is in my opinion Sean Penn's best role, i love the way he acts out and brings the character to life</body>
