 <body>   first of all we really don't have any constitutional "right" to vote for who is president in this country. the problem is that states (willingly) have lost their control and power over to the feds.</body>

 <body>   that's what the 10th amendment is.  if you are inferring a true democracy, then you are a fool to think that is an effective form of "mob rule" government.</body>

 <body>    I want a direct democracy. Community makes the decisions and there is no authority. Sounds like a good plan to me. It is the only form of government that I can support as the people would actually get what they want.</body>

 <body>   Justin, that's a really poor idea. I've got to run out but when I get back I'll explain why if no one else has in the meantime.</body>

 <body>   Please educate me. Anarchist Communism is the only form of government I'll ever support. I very much doubt you will tell me what I haven't been told before.   I feel sorry for de-railing this thread.</body>

 <body>>> Better hope Hillary is the NOMINEE! <<  No, I don't hope that at all LOL. That is why I voted for Obama. If I personally believed Hillary should be the nominee, I would have voted that way, just like millions of others, so this flies in the face of logic. That argument, I suppose is more applicable to those who have yet to go to the ballot box.  If the Dems and other cross-party voters wanted Hillary to get the nod, she'd be in the lead. If she somehow pulled it off, well, I would question how she did that, but that would be a fair question, especially since she has already publicly questioned the legitimacy of Obama's (most likely) nomination.  And she's running for what party again? But, that's another topic.  I do not have confidence that if Hillary were the nominee that she will be able to retain all Dems and also attract the cross-party voters that McCain enjoys. In fact, I believe if Hillary were the nominee, it would guarantee a loss against McCain, she is that divisive, and that didn't just start yesterday. Instead of the Dems being able to walk into the White House - which we should after this 8 year catastrophe - we have to fight for our lives, and that is really lame, frankly. But, the Republicans are not going to roll over as they really should. McCain will work hard this year and "Hillary Clinton - President" is a rallying cry for not just Republicans, but the other voters I just mentioned. Obama and McCain both have cross-party appeal, and that levels the playing field a great, great deal.  >> Obama makes it to the White House, he'll also have to surpass a number of other historical milestones. <<  ...as he already has, so people do have recent experiences to demonstrate that he is able to break through such "milestones". But it would be more accurate to say that the voting patterns of the general electorate would have to counter those milestones, it's not just Obama alone that must make this happen. It will take millions to make those changes, and he clearly has already mobilized Democrats, Republicans, Independents, and so many other cross socio-economic-racial-geodemographics that Hillary has not. And Limbaugh dittoheads going to vote for Hillary in open primaries doesn't constitute cross-party appeal, by the way. That's fear-of-an-Obama-McCain-match, which of course, is telling.  Right now, of course the polls will show McCain leading either candidate. That is not surprising, he's running several laps ahead of the Dems while we continue to vote. I agree with Obama that Clinton should keep running, and the people who haven't voted should cast their votes like everyone else. I'm confident. I believe people continue to hunger for the type of Presidency that Obama is offering and will ultimately want to close the door on the seemingly endless Bush-Clinton see-saw.  >> Obama is a power hungry politician who has never had a real job other than running for office to get more power. <<  Yeah. Um, finally, I think it's unwise to try to change or even dupe people into buying the image that Clinton (either one) is not extremely ambitious and will stop at nothing to win and then try to hang that jacket on Obama. Seriously, Americans are really not that stupid. She absolutely wants people to think she is inevitable, to be feared, never to be challenged or crossed. Yes, her other job included being a corporate lawyer. Corporate lawyers are notoriously power-averse. Bwhahaha.</body>
