 <body>I guess now they don't have to feel bad about water boarding.  Honestly, this isn't a surprise at all. It's just one step closer to a full blown fascist dictatorship.</body>

 <body>Hmmmmm, the Human Rights Council, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch....a stellar cast of well meaning but useless and ineffective organizations.</body>

 <body>  Ineffective? ...maybe. Symbolic....yes indeed. Now we have made the declaration that we could give a damn about you or your wife & kids. Action & words....We mean business!</body>

 <body>I'll have to agree, my use of the term "useless" was a very poor choice of words.Â  In the final analysis, as politically "ineffective" as they are, at least "AI" and "HRW" represent what appears to be as the last vestige of a united world-wide morality.</body>

 <body>It probably means that as a sovereign nation, the US doesn't have to submit to someone elses new world order; especially when it sets itself against the interests of this sovereign nation.  After all, these organizations are cheap and shoddy, and lacking gravitas.  You know, kind of like the U.N. only worse.</body>

 <body>Good to hear this. The Human Rights Council is a sham. They can't seem to decide if the situation in Darfur is genocide, but they are certainly quick to condemn Denmark for thought-crime violations for the Muhammed cartoons.</body>

 <body> That's why the Bush administration decided to "go it alone" in Iraq, instead of sitting around with the lazy asses aka the UN "Security" Council.  If those guys had brains, they'd take em' out and play with em'.</body>

 <body>China, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia are in the Human Wrongs Council.  That tells me nothing right there.</body>
