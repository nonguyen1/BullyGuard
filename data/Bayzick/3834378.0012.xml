 <body>  Ours hasn't progressed that badly. Secondary and College is free, University can be done via a special loan from Gov. So theres no money restricting someone if they want to go Uni. We open our colleges to Europeans and immigrants who are hard working tbh, but then you hear the small amount of British complaining how immigrants are "stealing jobs" (when immigrants do it better)</body>

 <body>  I'm glad you brought it up because I was shocked that when I came kids in this country thought I was a genius for being able to have highest grades in math... In my country, I was simply an average student in math...</body>
