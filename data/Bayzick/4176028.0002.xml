 <body>Gil. Yes, thank you. You have proved yourself to be an idiot time and time again on these forums, you didn't need to tell us.  and Corey. Try not to think too high and mighty of yourself considering you were 4 years old, still pissing in your pants when i was born. I posted the John Stewart clip simply because it was humorous. I do not solely receive my facts from comedy central. If you do not believe any of the things John Stewart is saying perhaps you should look them up.   ohh man. All of you conservatives are so full of rage whenever your beliefs are questioned. Well guess what EVOLUTION IS REAL and there is no easter bunny. Sorry!  Maybe you should go kill a poor defenseless animal with your shiny guns and refuse a child with cancer health care. That should brighten your day up. Turn that frown upside down!</body>

 <body>yeah, some people think it in a way to help others providing everyone with health care and strengthening the lower class. other people believe on stepping on people below them in the ladder to make the rich richer and the poor poorer.   and some see hunted animals as poor & defenseless and others see it as useless beasts that feel no pain or terror that need to be kept under control.</body>

 <body>Some people are jealous of those that are more successful than them and want to take their money.  I can defeat any Liberal in a debate.  I was graduating High School when you where born.</body>

 <body>   Oh? and did you take the short bus gil? Newsflash. This, is not a debate. I gave two examples. I am sure there are people out there who are jealous of those that are more successful than myself and want to take their money.  However. I am not one of them. I am happy for people who have earned what they have but only on the condition that they attained it honestly. I think that anyone who attains anything they desire, not just money, by illegal, cruel, selfish and greedy behavior should be looked down upon.</body>

 <body> Hmm, give everybody health care and strengthen the lower class? So, I have to pay for all of the lazy ass people out there that don't want to get a job and give more hand outs to the lower class...I say hell no. But, you probably think to tax the rich is a good plan. As for the hunting...when was the last time you ate at McDonald or was that hair dye animal tested?</body>

 <body>  You are fucking ignorant. My mom. A 57 year old woman. lives in 500sf apartment in ghetto and she works 4 jobs. she can not afford health care. oh yeah but she is just lazy as all hell. unfortunately there are hundreds of thousands of lazy people like that in america I guess, by your logic. Those lazy mother fuckers need a couple more jobs and maybe sell their ass on the street huh?  With the price of tax going up it would pay for YOUR health care. YOU are not paying for anyone else. add it up dumb ass. My husbands parents pay 1700 each a month for their health care. Do you know why it is so high? Because that is how much Kaiser decided to charge them that much, no reason. But with free health care you get so much more. free mental health. free doctors visits. free medicine. free surgery. free dentistry. ect!  Do you have any idea how much, in our current world that would cost to get insurance for? wayy more than we would be paying on taxes a month.  Yes taking the insanely rich More than the poor is a good thing. McCain WANTS to tax the POOR more and give tax cuts to the rich. When I say insanely rich I do not mean like 60 k a year. I mean million..billion and trillionairs.  and no sorry. i do not eat fast food. and i use all organic, non-animal tested products. sorry to crush your hopes and dreams.</body>
