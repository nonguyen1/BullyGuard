 <body>Parents of 15 year old find $71,000 (US $ CASH) hidden in his closet. Does this headline look familiar? Of course it does. You most likely must have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program.    (U.S.A).    His mother was cleaning, and putting away laundry, when she came across a large brown paper bag. It was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15 year old sons closet.    Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag, and found it was full of cash. Five dollar bills, twenties, fifties and hundreds all neatly rubber-banded in labeled piles.    My first thought was that he had robbed a bank. said the 41-year-old women.    There was over $71,000 in that bag, thats more than my husband earns in a year.    The women immediately called her husband at the car dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered. He came home right away and they drove to the boys school and picked him up. Little did they suspect that, where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the boys closet.    As it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via e-mail, a type of Report to e-mail addresses that he obtained off the Internet every day. After school, for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom.    I just got the e-mail one day and I figured what the heck. I put my name on it like the instructions said and I started sending it out, said the clever 15 year old. The e-mail letter listed 5 addresses, and contained instructions to send one $5 dollar bill to each person on the list. Then delete the address at the bottom and move the others down, and finally, adding your name to the top of the list. The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in $5 bills within two weeks, if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5 address list.    I get junk e-mail all the time, and really did not think it was going to work, the boy continued. Within the first few days of sending out the e-mail, the post office box that his parents had gotten him for his video game magazine subscriptions began to fill up, not with magazines, but envelopes containing $5 dollar bills.    About a week later I rode my bike down to the post office and my box had 1 magazine, and about 300 envelopes stuffed in it. There was also a yellow slip that said I had to go to the (post office) counter. I thought I was in trouble or something. He goes on, I went up to the counter and they had a whole box of mail for me. I had to ride home and empty out my backpack, because I could not carry it all.    Over the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out e-mail.    The money just kept coming in, and I just kept sorting it out and stashing it in the closet, I barely had time for my homework. He had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $5 dollar bills for twenties, fifties and hundreds.    I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money, and he was outside waiting for me. One time the lady gave me a really strange look, and told me that she would not be able to do it for me. She told me my dad would have to come in and do it, so I just rode to the next bank down the street. (He laughs.) Surprisingly, the boy did not have any reason to be afraid. The reporting news team examined and investigated the so called "chain letter" the boy was sending out, and found out that it was not a chain letter at all. In fact, it was completely legal according to US Postal and lottery laws, Title 18, section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, section 3005 in the US code, also in the code of Federal regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state, A product or service must be exchanged for money received. Every $5 note that he received contained a little note that read, Please send me report number XYZ. This simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service, (the report on how to) for a $5 fee.    Here is the same letter that the 15 year old was sending out by E- mail, you can do exactly the same thing he was doing, simply by following the instructions in this letter.
