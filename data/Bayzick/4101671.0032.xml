 <body>I like both, but personally like liquor more.  I've actually had a friend constantly down my throat with "No, weed is the way to go!!! You'll feel so much better and less angry!!! Alcohol drinkers are always mad and no fun!!" and it's honestly making me hate the idea of smoking more and more.</body>

 <body>    still, you fags dont know that sexual expression beats that shit any time  not that im a perv, its just that,  sexuality is natural. your brain has instincts relating to it. if youre going to do something "bad", do something that nature intends.</body>

 <body>pot is grown in nature, and saying nature didn't intend for us to smoke pot, is like saying God made a mistake when he created it. agree? same goes for mushrooms and opium. not that ive ever done any of it</body>
