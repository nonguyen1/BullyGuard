 <body> That "$omething" is MONEY which means if you are "indigent" be prepared to do time in jail or face the death penalty if you happen to be innocent. This is why hundreds of drug dealers, pimps,"hitmen","mafiosos", crooked politicians get off "scot free" in America 'cause justice is NOT cheap!!</body>

 <body>How nice that you have no problem with them letting an innocent man rot in prison for over 20 years.</body>

 <body>  Don't know who you're addressing but I have a HUGE problem with it. As officers of the Court they have a duty to bring forth the evidence.Â  Thet didn't and I think they should be de-barred for it.</body>

 <body> The man had no money and lawyers don't want non-paying "indigents" for clients. This why Joe Bannano did less then 14 months in jail in his entire life.</body>

 <body>greed, acquisitiveness, grabbiness, avarice, selfish desire, avidity, covetousness, cupidity,  and those are the positive points.   However...I feel compelled to point out that unlike Medical Doctors where true skill and deication is necessary, half the shit they do a regular person could do...were not not for the US legal system itself which makes it damn near impossible for non-licensed attorney to get anywhere.</body>

 <body> Did you mentioned that these two "jokers" were "public defenders"? I wonder where "OJ" Simson would be today if his "dream team" was court appointed!!</body>
