 <body>American Revolution - British pulled out and let you have it since we had more pressing concerns at home fighting the French.  War of 1812 - America's aim was to take Canada or atleast parts of Canada and you failed.  World War I - You didnt save shit, you arried 3 years late. British army was the decisive force in WWI.  World War II - If you guys came into it from the start and didnt wait for Japan & Germany to declair war on you then 6 Million Jews would not have died because Britain & America would have been doing joint operations together since 1939.  Boston tea party:  "Everyone has heard of the 'Boston Tea Party' of 16 December 1773, in which 342 boxes of tea worth ÃÂ£10,000 were tipped from the East India tea ship Dartmouth into the murky waters of Boston harbour. But most people assume it was a protest against a hike in the tax on tea. In fact the price of the tea in question was exceptionally low, since the British government had just given the East India Company a rebate of the much higher duty the tea had incurred on entering Britain. In effect, the tea left Britain duty free and had to pay only the much lower American duty on arriving in Boston. Tea had never been cheaper in New England. The 'Party' was organized not by irate consumers but by Boston's wealthy smugglers, who stood to lose out"</body>

 <body>Well, as others have already said, it was at a bar and it is quite silly to judge an entire nation solely on your experience there. It isn't valid evidence for what you are arguing.  However... I do believe that Americans, whilst not being inherently less intelligent, are, on average, more ignorant than other nationalities about the world around them. Why? Americans grow up without many "outside" influences in the media - I would say that 98 percent of your television and film content is American made, american produced, directed, acted..... most of the music that gets commercial airplay in the states are also very much american dominated. Also, geographically, america is quite isolated, really.... sure, britain is an island, but it's only a hop skip and a jump to about 20 different countries...</body>
