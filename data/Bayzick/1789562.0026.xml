 <body>I hated that new Fantastic Four movie, but if I had to pick any of those that were good portrayals, I liked the guy who played The Thing. The rest: human torch: good looks doesn't equal good acting, he was more annoying than anything :P Jessica Alba..just no haha and Mr. Fantastic eh, I don't even remember his performance. Can't believe there's gonna be more :(    Eric Bana was a pretty good Bruce Banner.</body>

 <body>    agreed, the lee/ditko era satrted it off, and the movie was based on those portrayls. but i would of felt a lot better watching a lee/romita style spidey, cause i believe this is where the stories became mature and peter grew into guy i would of liked to hang out with. the problem also being that the spidey movies are moving into the romita decade but the preformance is staying in the ditko, and while im sure the cgi will wow the audience i just know id never be able to just kick back with the peter on the big screen.</body>
