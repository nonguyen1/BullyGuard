 <body>    Well yeah, it is really just a matter of personal taste, and I probably should've said as much in my own comment. Personally, I love Kubrick, but I know that there are many people who consider his films cold and impersonal, saying that they just "couldn't get into" them. Certainly I don't like EVERY film he did; his last one "Eyes Wide Shut" left me disappointed. Nonetheless, I think overall he was a master craftsman who tried something different each time. Hell, some people look forward to every Spielberg movie made.    The point I was just making is that all personal opinion or taste aside, bearing in mind what Kubrick and Scorsese accomplished over the course of the last several decades (it's hard to imagine sci-fi films without the influence of "2001, " it's hard to imagine what DeNiro's career would've become if he hadn't made such an impression in "Mean Streets, " or how people like Tarantino would've come into their own without his influence), it's going to be difficult to find many other people who share your opinion that the Coens are the better filmmakers.</body>

 <body>    You're way off the mark pal.    Firstly, Tarantino draws influence from a multitude of film makers. More from the likes of Boorman & DePalma than Scorsese.... but I digress.    There will be plenty of people who share my opinion on the Coens. Like you say Scorsese is responsible for Robert DeNiro's career, likewise the Coens can be considered responsible for Francis McDormand's, John Tuturro, Sam Raimi's, Barry Sonnenfeld's, Holly Hunter's and many more.    They're equally the craftsmen that Scorsese is. Infact, they have a better hit & miss rate than Scorsese. But this is just going to turn into a ping-pong match. Just dont underestimate these fellas.</body>

 <body>    Thats interesting mate, and respect to you for it! What serious flaws would you say are in Barton Fink and I find it very interesting that Blood Simple only gets a "good" ranking and not a "classic" one... :) Next to Fargo, its one of the best examples of film noir there is.</body>

 <body>      And I suppose you KNOW the mark, hmm? Really, to be WAY off the mark would be to say that Tarantino was absolutely, in no way, shape or form influenced by Scorsese. Hell, ANYONE who watches his films knows that he draws from a variety of influences, from blaxploitation, Hong Kong/kung fu films, Hitchcock AND DePalma, Peckinpah, drive-in/exploitation cinema, spaghetti westerns, and numerous others, including the gangster/tough guy films of Lee Marvin, Sonny Chiba, John Woo, and... Martin Scorsese. Of course, Harvey Keitel first came to prominence by appearing in Scorsese's movies, from "I Call First"/Who's That Knocking At My Door, " "Mean Streets" "(w/ DeNiro, who of course appeared in "Jackie Brown"), "Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, " "Taxi Driver, " "Last Temptation"; clearly Tarantino had his "Mean Streets" connection in mind when he landed him in "Reservoir Dogs." He has stated before that "Mean Streets, " "Taxi Driver, " and "Goodfellas" are among some of his favorite films of all time. So yes, perhaps although he was influenced by the rape in John Boorman's "Deliverance" and his crime film "Point Blank, " his Scorsese influence is clearly evidenced in his shared casting, subject matter, similar use of pop music, and on many other levels.    Similarly, it's impossible to imagine how other underworld-themed movies and shows like "Donnie Brasco, " "Scarface, " and "The Sopranos" would be like had Scorsese not been around. Of course, they were probably equally influenced by "The Godfather, " but Scorsese's knowledge and love of the subject matter is readily apparent.    But the point is, noone's underestimating the Coens. They're great filmmakers. Many people have been influenced by Kubrick and Scorsese, inspired by their subject matter and technical achievements, but NOONE can make films quite like the Coens can. They have their own style, and yet try new things and reinvent themselves often, whether it's doing screwball comedy or film noir. Granted, it doesn't seem very LIKELY that they would choose to do a sci-fi film like Kubrick did in "2001, " or a controversial biblical work like "Last Temptation of Christ, " or a period epic like "Barry Lyndon, " or even a horror film like "The Shining, " but they are damned talented and anything's possible (hell, I for one would LOVE to see what kind of horror film they could possibly come up with). In some ways, they do however still have somewhat more of a niche, film-festival, film-critic, film-student audience than Kubrick or Scorsese--"O Brother" was a success, but it's definitely not for everyone--although they COULD indeed find a broader audience through another Award-nominated film like "Fargo, " or another cult classic like "Lebowski." And they have indeed helped foster the careers of all the actors and people you say, which overall is an even MORE impressive accomplishment than either Kubrick or Scorsese.    But really, it's like comparing apples and oranges, and nothing that benefits either of us to disagree over anymore. Hit & miss or not, Scorsese and Kubrick's successes have left their mark on the pop cultural landscape, and the overall face of modern cinema. Yet although they do both have success behind them, your Coens are still going strong and have many years ahead of them.    I think it's safe to say we all look forward to their next film either way.</body>
