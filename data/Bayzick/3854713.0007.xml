      <body>Kind of hard to ride a bike to work in California most people have to drive 20 to 60 miles one way to work. If you live in downtown NY, Chicago, Seatle or San Fransisco its possible but not most of the country</body>

      <body>  That sounds right. In the orginal 13 colonies if you had a farm or plantation, it was illegal to not grow hemp. But this gov't we have today does everything just the opposite of the founding fathers who's principles &amp; ideals made this country great. Look what these clowns are doing to it. I say we oust the bumbs Via that other great document called the Declaration of Independence.</body>

      <body>I always laughed at that suggestion when i was living in Missouri. I am NOT riding my bicycle 45 miles to work down a rural windy highway. People forget places still exist where you must go at least 30 miles to find a job. There was no town, just a stop sign on the pavement.</body>

      <body>Here, where I live and the oil boom going on, 2/3 of the population making in excess of $80,000.00 a year, are driving new trucks with big V/8s. Many of them have put custom wheels and other high-dollar accessories on them as well.</body>
