 <body>University of Utah Utes  We refer to the school as "the U" since it's all U's and we have like three colleges just in the city... and five more closely linked in concurrent enrollment and transfer within the 90 mile radius of us. Our mascot... an Eagle? I have no idea. Everytime I've been to a football game I went drunk so really I was in the stands to be loud, obnoxious, and crazy.</body>
