 <body>Unanswered Phone Calls in Venezuela: Human Rights Watch Exposes Hugo Chavez Yet Again October 10th 2008, by Joe Emersberger - HaitiAnalysis.com Human Rights Watch (HRW) recently published a 230 page report onVenezuela entitled ""A Decade Under Chávez: Political Intolerance andLost Opportunities for Advancing Human Rights in Venezuela," In a press release about the report, HRW's Americas director, JoseMiguel Vivanco stated that "rather than advancing rights protections"the Chavez government has "moved in the opposite direction, sacrificingbasic guarantees in pursuit of its own political agenda. " One of the report's findings is so explosive that it deserves to be quoted at length: "Government officials routinely deny or fail to respond to requests for information by journalists. According to an investigation by Últimas Noticias, a generally progovernment newspaper, journalists have encountered obstacles in obtaining information from the police on crime statistics, judges and court officials, hospitals, state enterprises such as PDVSA, the comptroller general's office, and various ministries... According to a log publicized by the newspaper El Mundo, only 37.5 percent of the officials responded to requests for official information made by its investigative reporters in 2007. The average wait for a reply was 38 days, almost twice the legal maximum. For example, a reporter approached the Ministry of Planning and Development to get information about the salaries of public employees. It took seven months, three letters, and a change of vice-minister before a reply was received. " [1] My heart goes out to those journalists who have not receivedreplies - or have had to endure waits of up to seven months beforereceiving one. Apologists for Chavez may point out that HRW was nottalking about inquiries into horrific atrocities like the ones carriedout by the US backed government in Colombia, and that nothing like thatis mentioned in the report, but such people don't understand the agonyof being ignored. I know because I have been writing and telephoningHRW for years and have never received a reply. I have a zero percentsuccess rate - much worse than El Mundo's - so I can feel their pain.[2] HRW also found that "Venezuela still enjoys a vibrant publicdebate in which anti-government and pro-government media are equallyvocal in their criticism and defense of Chávez". It said that theChavez government has greatly expanded funding for communitybroadcasters and that a "...large majority of community radio stationsare supportive of the Chávez government. However, they are notpolitically homogeneous, and by no means uncritical". None of that, ofcourse, should distract us from the suffering of those journalistswaiting for replies about government salaries. Now that HRW has blown the lid off the grave human rightsabuse of unanswered questions, perhaps they can finally respond tothese questions: 1) When a coup deposed Chavez for 2 days in 2002, why didHRW's public statements fail to do obvious things like denounce thecoup, call on other countries not to recognize the regime, invoke theOAS charter, and (especially since HRW is based in Washington) call foran investigation of US involvement? 2) Very similarly, when a coup deposed Haiti's democraticallyelected government in 2004, why didn't HRW condemn the coup, call onother countries not to recognize the regime, invoke the OAS charter,and call for an investigation of the US role? Many of these things weredone by the community of Caribbean nations (CARICOM). A third of the UNGeneral Assembly called for an investigation into the overthrow ofAristide. Why didn't HRW back them up? 3) Since 2004, why has HRW written about 20 times more aboutVenezuela than about Haiti despite the fact that the coup in Haiticreated a human rights catastrophe in which thousands of politicalmurders were perpetrated and the jails filled with political prisoners?Haiti's judiciary remains stacked with holdovers from the coupinstalled regime. The lingering impact of the coup is revealed by arecent ruling by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR) infavor of Yvon Neptune. Haiti has ignored the IACHR order that itdismiss the case against Neptune and pay damages for his illegal twoyear imprisonment. [3] HRW has not publicly urged the Haitiangovernment to obey the ruling, nor has it applied any public pressureon the government to investigate the disappearance of Lovinsky PierreAntoine, a leading human rights activist.[4] 4) Why did HRW never write a word in support of Father GerardJean-Juste, Haiti's most prominent political prisoner after the coup?Even after Amnesty International named him a "prisoner of conscience"and participated in an international campaign to have him released toreceive treatment for cancer, HRW said absolutely nothing. Instead HRWhas repeatedly objected to law suits brought against Venezuelan "civilsociety" leaders like Maria Corina Machado, who has never been jaileddespite signing the infamous Carmon decree which briefly abolishedVenezuelan democracy.[5] 5) Why hasn't HRW called for a full disclosure of US fundingof the opposition in Bolivia given the murders recently perpetrated inPando by anti-government groups? HRW has called on the OAS toinvestigate the Colombian government's allegations that the Chavezassists the FARC. In contrast, HRW has not urged the US government tocooperate with the Freedom of Information Act requests made by JeremyBigwood regarding US activity Bolivia.[6] HRW has routinely ignored critics who have shown that it hasincreasingly become a tool of US imperialism. Ed Herman, David Petersonand George Szamuely wrote an very extensive and damning assessment ofHRW's role as a "campaigner for the NATO Wars in the Balkans". MichaelBarker has produced detailed criticism. Jonathan Cook, NormanFinkelstein and Sara Founders have highlighted flagrant imperial biasin HRW statements involving Israel. HRW did repy to one article byJoanthan Cook but only after distorting what he had written. Cookpointed out in response "If this is how one of the directors of HRW distorts myarguments and evidence when I carefully set out my case in black andwhite on the page, one has to wonder how faithfully she and herorganisation sift the evidence in the far trickier cases relating tohuman rights, where things are rarely so black and white." Cook did not hear from HRW again.[7] In a press release of 2006, HRW stooped to denying Palestiniansthe right to non-violent self defence. The outcry against the absurdityof it was so overwhelming that HRW published a retraction. [8] Muchmore typically, as in the case of Kevin Pina's open letter to JoseMiguel Vivanco, HRW has simply stayed silent.[9] With the exception of Jonathan Cook, nowhere on HRW's website does onefind any mention of the critics cited above. However, one can easilyfind a lengthy reply to Michael Spagat whose attempt to depict HRW assoft on the Colombian FARC rebels was comically inept.[10] Now I admit I've exaggerated the sympathy I feel for Venezuelanjournalists sitting by their phones or refreshing their inboxesawaiting replies from the Chavez government. A certain callousness setsin when one recalls what the US and its allies have achieved in Haiti -and hope to achieve in Venezuela. And though I disagree with HRW beingexpelled from Venezuela I find it difficult to see why it should botheranyone more than unanswered phone calls to reporters (which I alsodisagree with). HRW has, at the very least, a close relationship withthe National Endowment for Democracy (NED), a barely disguised branchof the US government devoted to undermining democracy. [11] Needless tosay, if the Venezuelan government had funded groups who had brieflyoverthrown the US government, and then sabotaged the US economy, aCaracas based group would not be attending press conferences inWashington criticizing t
