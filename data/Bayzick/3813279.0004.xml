 <body>His only decent films have been Lock Stock & Snatch  And i'm not saying that because they are British films. Stratham seems to have been typecast into this second rate action star, he needs a new agent/choose his roles alot better. Maybe go down the Indie root and get some interesting scripts.</body>

 <body> Thought about this over dinner and I think maybe the action films do suit him. He can say a lot with the expression on his face and his movies aren't slowed down by a lot of dialogue. I don't necessary like all the hand to hand combat but I can tolerate it because I know he'll win and look good doing it.</body>

 <body> Watched this movie 2 x's in 4 days liked it. In 1971 London, a car dealer and his gang of thieves break into a bank vault and find far more than cash and jewelry. Saffron Burrows plays a good role in this Action Crime drama Thriller. Based on a true story. One of the Largest heist in History. F.Y.I.- It came to the Cinemas on Friday, March 7th, 2008 not the 9th</body>

 <body>He's great. I loved him in War, which would have been an awesome movie if the ending wasn't such a fail.</body>
