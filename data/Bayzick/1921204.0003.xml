 <body>I'd like to think that I'm pretty open minded and I'm not going to say that something like that COULDN'T happen. But did anyone see the documentary that they made about the real Amityville story? Seemed like a bunch of crap to me.    For the movie, I prefer the original.</body>

 <body>    yeah I mean hauntings really DO happen. but I've heard people say that the basement in the amity house is suppossedly the gateway to hell. and the movie made it look so fictional. I don't think that I'm 100% right, but it just seemed unrealistic to me though..</body>

 <body>I thought the remake was better. It didn't just focus on the haunting of a house. It also focused on one of the family members losing his sanity from mere thoughts coming from the house. The original I found was crap.</body>

 <body>    You should try and watch the documentary. It's called The Real Amityville Horror. It was made for channel 4 here in the UK. It's interesting to see all sides of the story. When the family moved into the house, even though it was cheap after the murders, they'd taken on a much higher mortgage than they could afford and the father's business was failing. The guy that murdered his family in the house, Ronald DeFeo, it was his defence attorney that met with the Lutz family, and soon afterwards they came out with the story of the haunting, hoping that it would get DeFeo a retrial. And making the Lutzs quite a bit of money. The guy that wrote the book apparently never cared if the story was true or not. All all further residents of the house have reported nothing unusual.    It would be sad if it was all a hoax.    But it does make for a good story :)</body>

 <body>    Probably not, no. They're not great movies by any stretch of the imagination. But the original is worth a watch, and I do have a taste for bad horror movies.</body>

 <body>    I just found the original to be really, really boring.      But it did spawn a ton of cheesy, semi-entertaining sequels. It certainly belongs in the 70s kitsch horror genre.</body>
