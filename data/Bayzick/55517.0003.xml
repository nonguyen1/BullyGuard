 <body>Both are important, but i think the major is even more so... depends on what jobs are available what is needed, if a teacher is needed they are going to look for a teacher, historian they will look for a history major... it all goes, there is less you can do wiith a communications degree then you can do with an education degree</body>

 <body>The right major... I don't care if you went to Harvard or ASU, if you major in Women's Studies you will never earn as much money as the person who got an M.D.</body>
