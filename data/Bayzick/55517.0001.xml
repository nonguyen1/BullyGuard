 <body>well it depends, pretty much a combination of both. if you major in psychology at a major party school compared to an ivy league school, then your chances of making more money lessen. it also depends on what major you plan on going into. if your school is reputable for whatever major you want to pursue then yea go for it.</body>

 <body>I think its the school, because its the school that provides you the enviornment where you can network and get your contacts established, which leads to job oppurtunities.</body>

 <body>Both are important, but i think the major is even more so... depends on what jobs are available what is needed, if a teacher is needed they are going to look for a teacher, historian they will look for a history major... it all goes, there is less you can do wiith a communications degree then you can do with an education degree</body>
