 <body> Gothika was a bad movie period... Just becasue i hated that movie doesn't mean i didn't like him.. hell I hated the Happening, doesn't mean i hated Mark Walberg who will redeem himself with Max Payne.. And i did see The Shaggy Dog.  Downey has always been a good actor, it was his personal life that got in his way, and Ironman just put him in the comeback seat and he has looked back so far..</body>

 <body>  It's I Am Sam... ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER BLOODY MADE IMO.  And is in my opinion Sean Penn's best role, i love the way he acts out and brings the character to life</body>

 <body>  I know that about Sean Penn, that what makes his films a joy to see, but IMO this is his best role. I love the way he brings the character to life, he makes you give a sense of feel for the character.  I know this will probably sound over-rating but honestly i don't care.  Sean Penn's role as Sam can nearly only be recgonised to as Heath's portrayal as The Joker. Even though they are different characters, yes that i know but both actors brought the characters to life</body>
