 <body>Just for perspective, or curiosity value -- when Obama has decided on his VP choice, the name of that person will be announced not only by the standard means, but simultaneously by e-mail and text.ÃÂ  Herewith:  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Dear James --  Barack Obama is about to make one of the most important decisions of this campaign -- choosing a running mate.  You have helped build this movement from the bottom up, and Barack wants you to be the first to know his choice.  Sign up today to be the first to know:  http://my.barackobama.com/vp  You will receive an email the moment Barack makes his decision, or you can text VP to 62262 to receive a text message on your mobile phone.  Once you've signed up, please forward this email to your friends, family, and coworkers to let them know about this special opportunity.  No other campaign has done this before. You can be part of this important moment.  Be the first to know who Barack selects as his running mate.  Thanks,  David  David Plouffe Campaign Manager Obama for America  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------   This is just FYI. I'm not encouraging anyone to sign on unless they're so inclined.  Of course it's a gimmick, but a neat one, and a first.</body>

 <body>  If you think the US has 57 states you need to reread your history books. Obama never said their where 57 states. The GOP said Obama said that even though he didnt. I know its hard to seperate lies and the truth while in high school.</body>

 <body>ok not become some obama defender here but the 57 state thing, if you actually listen to the entire speech, was obviously just him misspeaking...that does happen sometimes, just as typos do.  as for the computer topic here, where someone is attempting to point out you don't need those skills to be president... well you do pass and enact legislation that effects it, so having a grasp on it yourself, instead of what your staff (with who knows what self/external motivation driving them) is advising you on certainly can't hurt. but if we are back around to the president not needing to know anything about puters in this day and age then we might as well go all the way and say, why does a president need to know anything at all...which then 100% mutes the "obama isn't experienced" line, which is kind of a crap argument anyway. but i think we have seen what happens when a president just doesn't know anything at all and gets all his info from his advisers...  heard today as well that obama would like to try to use the internet and other tech stuff to create a more transparent government that is a bit more accountable... ok so every politician lies and spouts bs. but have to say i like the idea behind that...wow being able to find out what goes on first hand...there is a novel thought.  honestly its 2008 right now, the US is still the worlds only hyper-power, we have the most advanced military in the world, the internet was born here, for better or worse everything is becoming networkable, there is concern we are going to fall behind other countries... and yet somehow it seems perfectly reasonable that the leader of the free world will yell across the white house, "honey come here and show me how to send an email again!" and we would rather him/her be advised by advisers being lobbyed by the telcos. yeah, good idea. w00t.</body>
