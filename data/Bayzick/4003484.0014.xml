 <body>Thats what your taught in berkeley huh. Maybe one day you will get your wish and those poor "suspected terrorists" will be allowed to freely walk the streets of America. After all it would be the just thing to do after "illegally" holding them against there will. Maybe we can give them a nice big house and a million dollars too. Perhaps a wall, like the Vietnam Memorial, where we can put the names of those terrorists who died "fighting the biggest threat in the world to human rights"</body>

 <body>Its not just terrorists we are talking about here, we have lost all sense of morality. We have lost our value for life and common decency, just look at our city streets. The nation's capital is setting checkpoints to curb crime, "patriots" suggest we shoot illegals on site, our law enforcement is just as corrupt as it is in Mexico, a 78 yr old man gets hit by a car and people just stand around and look, no one runs to help..etc etc. We have become worse then the terrorists we are supposedly fighting in the middle east.</body>

 <body>  I know.....Check Points. Don't people even realize that comes from Nazi Germany? What does that say about America? Anyway I heard they are going to be doing drug check points around these summer concerts that come up every year starting this summer. Man! They might find some serious convicts like a guy who smokes mariajuana!</body>

 <body> Well, maybe they'll pick YOU next time, Elmer Fudd... If you look too much like an Iraqi or they see some other minor coincidence that "alerts" them to perceive you as a threat. Of course, once they abduct you, you'll never get a trial or have any way to prove your innocence.  With an attitude like yours, you'd deserve it.</body>

 <body>  1 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.-- so which God is that, maybe I believe there's many Gods, and they all deserve the same amount of honor?  2 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:  oh....there's goes art classes in school...what about all those nice little nicknacks you see being sold in the store.  4 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. so, which day shall we keep holy, Saturday or Sunday...since we all won't be agreeing on this one, can we make them all holy and just forget about working.  6 Thou shalt not kill. have fun explaining war to the little tikes.  by the way, no one took God out of the schools....Christ lives in the hearts of his believers, the chirstian kids do take their hearts to school with them, don't they? God is in the schools, he speaks to the non-believers everyday in the school, not through words spoken, but through actions taken in kindness, gentleness, hopefullness, and all the other fruits of the spirit.</body>

 <body>  Your an ass. You think they just randomly picked some dude off the street cause he didn't shave or take a bath. You think they don't have a paper trail or some other evidence on him. You think there going to interrogate him and find he has no useful info and keep him. Look at the tens of 1000's of "suspected terrorists" that have been detained and released. Those ones don't count though do they.  Ever thought that maybe those detainees HAVE given useful info and are being held for there own safety from those that have about as much respect for there fellow man as we do mashing a cockroach. You know the ones who, without giving it a second thought would strap 10 pounds of C-4 to there body and blow up a marketplace. Who hack off the heads of there enemys then yell "Allah is Great".  Or maybe there some of the ones that would blow up a marketplace. You don't know the reason there being held. Yet your so quick to come to there defense. To the defense of a group of people that our government believes is a threat  You sound like your living some burned out hippie dream from the '60's. Those people we are fighting over there, given the chance, would cut out your heart quicker than you can say "peace and love". and it's spreading worldwide and has been for decades.  Have you conveinently forgotten when all those hijackings that took place in the '70s & 80's. or the killings they did in Africa or the bombs the've detonated all over the world. There the same people linked to the same twisted ideology they call religion and it's hundreds of years old. It's called Terrorism.  But then again your safe here arn't you. Chances of you or some loved one getting blown up at albertsons or your head chopped off are pretty remote isn't it. Your so wound up with the human rights issue, that your actually come to the support of the ones that are the cruelist abusers of it  WHY????</body>
