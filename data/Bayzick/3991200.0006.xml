 <body>   I think it would be difficult for Mr. Smith to be in I Am Legend 2.</body>

 <body>This is going to be very interesting!!  Silent Hill in my opinion was all I expected in a movie.. i have never played the games, but knew alot about the story...wonder where they are going to take this sequel!  Ace Ventura 3: oh please no!!!  The People Under The Stairs 2: wonder what made them after all these years to finally make a part 2.  The Untouchables: looking forward to this one!  Thought I heard a couple of years ago about Ghostship 2 being in post production? guess i heard wrong!</body>

 <body>every one of them a waste of film...maybe The Untouchables prequel about the rise of Capone will be good...</body>

 <body>Of those, only Toy Story 3 & Cars 2 will be worthwhile. The Untouchables? Why ruin a good thing? If it didn't work for Indiana Jones, it won't work for anything.</body>

 <body>I guess the movie industry is out of ideas. The original "Italian Job" with Michael Caine and Sir Nowell Coward is still unbeatable.</body>

 <body>Silent Hill I actually enjoyed the game & movie but it sucks they were saying they were gonna make the movie lead into the game.Not the new one but the older ones.They movie was just gory the game is freaky as hell well the first few.So I actually expected a horror movie not a gory movie.</body>
