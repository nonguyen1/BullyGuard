      <body>    Yes, I've seen it. I have a short review on my page (don't know if this is permitted to say, so delete /ignore/whatever! if so)    I highly recommend reading something about the movie before seeing it, if you plan to. Otherwise, most people will be befuddled, as the apparent plot isn't extremely clear - and lost in translation a bit too! I'm fascinated with the Inca, Aztec and Mayan cultures so was looking forward to seeing this. Don't know that this is a spectacular movie, but I think the depiction of the culture is pretty accurate.

      <body>    Kevin,    Excuse me for noticing your completely ignorant comments about the Mayan people. If you truly did visit the Mayan ruins than you should know, much better then someone who's only experience with the MAya is the Apocalypto, that they were one of the most sophisitcated and advanced civilizations of the era.  My complaint about the movie, which was otherwise fairly accurate, was that it did not highlight the many scientific, economic, and cultural acheivements of the Great Maya civilization. Accurate calendars, acheivements in astronomy such as the knowledge of precession, somehting that wasnt proven as a theory til this century.    Savages? Excuse me but have you watched the news lately? Almost 3000 dead in Iraq, that's savage and this is the modern age. Back then it was about survival and at least it was real warfare hand to hand combat and such, not this pussyshit long range nuclear warheads, armored vehicles and shit. I'm talking about knives, arrows, spears, and straight up martial arts.    Too bad people like you are out there mischaracterizing our culture. I would be doing a great disservice to history to not highlight the way in which the Europeans, obviously your ancestors, savagely murdered, diseased, raped and pillaged this great civilzation in the pursuit of material wealth and religious purity.    Back to the movie, I'm not sure what Gibson's point with the Spaniards at the end. The "when it rains it pours" element sort of takes away from the much more consistent and relevant "don't let history repeat itself" message. Thoughts?</body>

      <body>i was under the impression that the mayans were the peaceful ones and the aztecs were the bloodthirsty fighters anyways if it was the mayans in the movie than wouldnt the scene at the end be completely inaccurate because I thought the aztecs were visited and raped by the europeans not the mayans. mayans were long gone by then???</body>

      <body>i recall the timeline for central america was something like this: toltecs, mayans, and aztecs...maybe the news had it wrong or mel? anyway it was a good movie. oh and i know the whole timeline thing is off but i was just thinking of the last three major civilizations in central america so correct me if i'm wrong and no the Inca don't apply! "CENTRAL AMERICA, NOT SOUTH AMERICA!!!</body>

      <body>The film is great. Mel Gibson shows he passions thru he's films. BUT!!!! For those who done know the difference between Maya's and Aztec, Maya's are from south Mexico all the way down to Panama. Aztec's are from south Mexico and up to north Mexico.(more or less) Mel Gibson got the story or his info all wrong. They story is based in real events, but it was the Aztec who sacraficed 20, 000 indegenous people. The Maya's had mostly disapered by the time the Spanards landed in 1492. And it was Cortz who landed in Mexico, not Columbus.  I give Mel Gibson props for doing the film, just like Passion it will and had open conversions about those issues. Can't wait for a more factual film about the Maya's to be done. Ormaybe I'll sit down and write one for myself.  Well keep up with the topic cause its a good one.</body>
