 <body>      And I suppose you KNOW the mark, hmm? Really, to be WAY off the mark would be to say that Tarantino was absolutely, in no way, shape or form influenced by Scorsese. Hell, ANYONE who watches his films knows that he draws from a variety of influences, from blaxploitation, Hong Kong/kung fu films, Hitchcock AND DePalma, Peckinpah, drive-in/exploitation cinema, spaghetti westerns, and numerous others, including the gangster/tough guy films of Lee Marvin, Sonny Chiba, John Woo, and... Martin Scorsese. Of course, Harvey Keitel first came to prominence by appearing in Scorsese's movies, from "I Call First"/Who's That Knocking At My Door, " "Mean Streets" "(w/ DeNiro, who of course appeared in "Jackie Brown"), "Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, " "Taxi Driver, " "Last Temptation"; clearly Tarantino had his "Mean Streets" connection in mind when he landed him in "Reservoir Dogs." He has stated before that "Mean Streets, " "Taxi Driver, " and "Goodfellas" are among some of his favorite films of all time. So yes, perhaps although he was influenced by the rape in John Boorman's "Deliverance" and his crime film "Point Blank, " his Scorsese influence is clearly evidenced in his shared casting, subject matter, similar use of pop music, and on many other levels.    Similarly, it's impossible to imagine how other underworld-themed movies and shows like "Donnie Brasco, " "Scarface, " and "The Sopranos" would be like had Scorsese not been around. Of course, they were probably equally influenced by "The Godfather, " but Scorsese's knowledge and love of the subject matter is readily apparent.    But the point is, noone's underestimating the Coens. They're great filmmakers. Many people have been influenced by Kubrick and Scorsese, inspired by their subject matter and technical achievements, but NOONE can make films quite like the Coens can. They have their own style, and yet try new things and reinvent themselves often, whether it's doing screwball comedy or film noir. Granted, it doesn't seem very LIKELY that they would choose to do a sci-fi film like Kubrick did in "2001, " or a controversial biblical work like "Last Temptation of Christ, " or a period epic like "Barry Lyndon, " or even a horror film like "The Shining, " but they are damned talented and anything's possible (hell, I for one would LOVE to see what kind of horror film they could possibly come up with). In some ways, they do however still have somewhat more of a niche, film-festival, film-critic, film-student audience than Kubrick or Scorsese--"O Brother" was a success, but it's definitely not for everyone--although they COULD indeed find a broader audience through another Award-nominated film like "Fargo, " or another cult classic like "Lebowski." And they have indeed helped foster the careers of all the actors and people you say, which overall is an even MORE impressive accomplishment than either Kubrick or Scorsese.    But really, it's like comparing apples and oranges, and nothing that benefits either of us to disagree over anymore. Hit & miss or not, Scorsese and Kubrick's successes have left their mark on the pop cultural landscape, and the overall face of modern cinema. Yet although they do both have success behind them, your Coens are still going strong and have many years ahead of them.    I think it's safe to say we all look forward to their next film either way.</body>

 <body>Fargo - I still laugh at Steve Buscemi pushing the foot into the woodchipper. (I was the only one who laughed at that part in the theater... does that make me a sick twisted s.o.b?)    Oh brother    Rasing Arizona    the Big Lebowski all of the previous movies I own a copy on DvD    Seen once:    Miller's Crossing    Hudsucker Proxy    Blood Simple    the movies I only saw once and could care less if they were destroyed:    Intolerable Cruelty    Lady Killers    The Man Who Wasn't There, I know their attempt at film noir. I fell asleep the two times I tried to watch it.    Barton Fink - uhm.... yeah.... I just didn't get it.</body>
