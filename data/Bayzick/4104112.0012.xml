 <body>you can't judge the US as a WHOLE just because some bimbos asked you questions that were dumb. Its very critical of you to do that. Not everyone is like that. its like when the French people call Americans pigs. Not everyone is the same.</body>

 <body>American Revolution - British pulled out and let you have it since we had more pressing concerns at home fighting the French.  War of 1812 - America's aim was to take Canada or atleast parts of Canada and you failed.  World War I - You didnt save shit, you arried 3 years late. British army was the decisive force in WWI.  World War II - If you guys came into it from the start and didnt wait for Japan & Germany to declair war on you then 6 Million Jews would not have died because Britain & America would have been doing joint operations together since 1939.  Boston tea party:  "Everyone has heard of the 'Boston Tea Party' of 16 December 1773, in which 342 boxes of tea worth ÃÂ£10,000 were tipped from the East India tea ship Dartmouth into the murky waters of Boston harbour. But most people assume it was a protest against a hike in the tax on tea. In fact the price of the tea in question was exceptionally low, since the British government had just given the East India Company a rebate of the much higher duty the tea had incurred on entering Britain. In effect, the tea left Britain duty free and had to pay only the much lower American duty on arriving in Boston. Tea had never been cheaper in New England. The 'Party' was organized not by irate consumers but by Boston's wealthy smugglers, who stood to lose out"</body>
