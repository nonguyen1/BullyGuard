 <body>  Don't know who you're addressing but I have a HUGE problem with it. As officers of the Court they have a duty to bring forth the evidence.Â  Thet didn't and I think they should be de-barred for it.</body>

 <body> The man had no money and lawyers don't want non-paying "indigents" for clients. This why Joe Bannano did less then 14 months in jail in his entire life.</body>

 <body>greed, acquisitiveness, grabbiness, avarice, selfish desire, avidity, covetousness, cupidity,  and those are the positive points.   However...I feel compelled to point out that unlike Medical Doctors where true skill and deication is necessary, half the shit they do a regular person could do...were not not for the US legal system itself which makes it damn near impossible for non-licensed attorney to get anywhere.</body>

 <body> Did you mentioned that these two "jokers" were "public defenders"? I wonder where "OJ" Simson would be today if his "dream team" was court appointed!!</body>

 <body>public defenders are the worst of the bunch. they don't care about the client if you are innocent they will sell you up the river. they will not show up to hearings, show up late & basically do what they can to make you look guilty when you aren't. when you are on your way to jail they will sit back & say "I tried" when laughing at you. fuckin scumbags the lot of them.</body>
