 <body>yeah, some people think it in a way to help others providing everyone with health care and strengthening the lower class. other people believe on stepping on people below them in the ladder to make the rich richer and the poor poorer.   and some see hunted animals as poor & defenseless and others see it as useless beasts that feel no pain or terror that need to be kept under control.</body>

 <body>Some people are jealous of those that are more successful than them and want to take their money.  I can defeat any Liberal in a debate.  I was graduating High School when you where born.</body>

 <body>   Oh? and did you take the short bus gil? Newsflash. This, is not a debate. I gave two examples. I am sure there are people out there who are jealous of those that are more successful than myself and want to take their money.  However. I am not one of them. I am happy for people who have earned what they have but only on the condition that they attained it honestly. I think that anyone who attains anything they desire, not just money, by illegal, cruel, selfish and greedy behavior should be looked down upon.</body>

 <body> Hmm, give everybody health care and strengthen the lower class? So, I have to pay for all of the lazy ass people out there that don't want to get a job and give more hand outs to the lower class...I say hell no. But, you probably think to tax the rich is a good plan. As for the hunting...when was the last time you ate at McDonald or was that hair dye animal tested?</body>

 <body>  You are fucking ignorant. My mom. A 57 year old woman. lives in 500sf apartment in ghetto and she works 4 jobs. she can not afford health care. oh yeah but she is just lazy as all hell. unfortunately there are hundreds of thousands of lazy people like that in america I guess, by your logic. Those lazy mother fuckers need a couple more jobs and maybe sell their ass on the street huh?  With the price of tax going up it would pay for YOUR health care. YOU are not paying for anyone else. add it up dumb ass. My husbands parents pay 1700 each a month for their health care. Do you know why it is so high? Because that is how much Kaiser decided to charge them that much, no reason. But with free health care you get so much more. free mental health. free doctors visits. free medicine. free surgery. free dentistry. ect!  Do you have any idea how much, in our current world that would cost to get insurance for? wayy more than we would be paying on taxes a month.  Yes taking the insanely rich More than the poor is a good thing. McCain WANTS to tax the POOR more and give tax cuts to the rich. When I say insanely rich I do not mean like 60 k a year. I mean million..billion and trillionairs.  and no sorry. i do not eat fast food. and i use all organic, non-animal tested products. sorry to crush your hopes and dreams.</body>

 <body>Meg.: You are fucking ignorant. My mom. A 57 year old woman. lives in 500sf apartment in ghetto and she works 4 jobs. she can not afford health care.   Meg is either lying or heartless.  Meg.: My husbands parents pay 1700 each a month for their health care. Do you know why it is so high? Because that is how much Kaiser decided to charge them that much, no reason. But with free health care you get so much more. free mental health. free doctors visits. free medicine. free surgery. free dentistry. ect!  Bless her heart. She thinks doctors, dentists, and psychiatrists work for free.   Meg.: Do you have any idea how much, in our current world that would cost to get insurance for? wayy more than we would be paying on taxes a month.   I wonder why she think this...  Meg.:  i do not eat fast food. and i use all organic, non-animal tested products.   I understand now. Bless her heart.</body>

 <body>first off i was sorta making a joke but i see it failed with ur liberal views. i actually love to watch his show takes me away fromt he stupidity of polictics and makes me laugh again.  oh and i four i wasnt pissing in my pants sorry you grew up that way. and not all conservatives are full a rage i find it fun to debate with Respecftul and educated democrates. but what i do get pissed at i will say is how no one has yet to ask obama the real questions. for example, MSNBC, The View and ophrah have all had obama one thier shows or network and have treated him like a god, and someone who has ben in washington for a long time and knows the answer to everything but yet didnt ask him anything. all the shows we have seen except for ophrah have had mccain on them and have "tried" to attack him but have failed.  if you dont believe me just watch barbra walters on the view who kept trying to attack mccain and make him look bad just cuz he didnt know how many house's he owns which really are all owned by his wifes company. but all they could ask obama was about the rumour of him being related to brad pitt. WOW cuz its so important to know about that.  I say 1 time put both in a room with normal people to ask questions and lets see what happens.  thats all i really mad at everything else is fun to watch, hell even snl got a laugh out of me on the palin look a like.</body>
