 <body> The only thing good about the ending to Citizen Kane is that it ended: boring. The credits are the highlight of the film.</body>

 <body>  Oh right, was that why it became the most acclaimed film of all time? Actually Citizen Kane is a brilliant film, it was highly influential, it was a landmark in filmmaking, it practically changed the way films are made, Orson Welles created a certain cinematography in the film that is revolutionary</body>

 <body>Hm...I don't really pay attention to which endings I like best, but I must say I like the ending to the movie Wanted. I saw it yesterday. Actually, the whole movie was pretty good. IT was kind of confusing at time sbecause of the flashbacks and all, but I'd say it's better than a lot of the films that has been ocming out lately.</body>

 <body> Just 'starting'? Wow! Normally it takes a mere few moments for someone to dislike me. This must be a record!  Alright alright... here it is... dislike me if you will   'What's Eating Gilbert Grape' & 'The Other Boleyn Girl'     AND  I keep coming around to 'Sin City'... I just love how that ends.</body>
