      <body>Actually, I gotta big dog. I can just slap a couple of commercial liscense plates on him and ride him to work. Don't think I haven't been considering it either. And how the hell do you explain the fact that Diesel fuel is the most expensive out of them all??? It's the most unrefined fuel on the market. It's junk fuel and it used to be a little more expensive than dirt! Now it's like gold! WTF???</body>

      <body>Bringing back mass transit would be ideal. Filling up the average Semi costs $600.00, why not put that money back on the rails? It would take a long time to update the country, decades most likely, but the end result could/would be fantastic.</body>

      <body>Kind of hard to ride a bike to work in California most people have to drive 20 to 60 miles one way to work. If you live in downtown NY, Chicago, Seatle or San Fransisco its possible but not most of the country</body>

      <body>  That sounds right. In the orginal 13 colonies if you had a farm or plantation, it was illegal to not grow hemp. But this gov't we have today does everything just the opposite of the founding fathers who's principles &amp; ideals made this country great. Look what these clowns are doing to it. I say we oust the bumbs Via that other great document called the Declaration of Independence.</body>

      <body>I always laughed at that suggestion when i was living in Missouri. I am NOT riding my bicycle 45 miles to work down a rural windy highway. People forget places still exist where you must go at least 30 miles to find a job. There was no town, just a stop sign on the pavement.</body>

      <body>Here, where I live and the oil boom going on, 2/3 of the population making in excess of $80,000.00 a year, are driving new trucks with big V/8s. Many of them have put custom wheels and other high-dollar accessories on them as well.</body>
