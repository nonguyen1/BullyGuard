 <body>  i don't think you know what you're talking about   wholesale oil prices have come down to some degree  consumer prices are somewhat flexible upward, but strictly  sticky downward; so, gas prices will not fall significantly unless  the decreased demand for it, can be maintained for some time</body>

 <body>  the last time we had gas prices rise, sales of pickup trucks and suvs fell sharply only to pick up again when prices fell. but most people think we aren't gonna see gas in 2 dollar range ever again. why should they reduce the price? the don't have to and nobody seems to know why they are up so high anyhow.</body>

 <body>   If a Democrat becomes President they will raise taxes, causing the cost of fuel to go up. If you know anything about production, you will then know the Government taxes every gallon a gas purchased at the pumps. The Government makes more money off a gallon of fuel that the oil companies.  If they raise taxes, this will probably include the fuel tax, increasing prices of each gallon you pump into your vehicle.</body>

 <body>   Link didn't work for me . . . but here's something I find ironic. I heard on the radio this morning. Ok with all the hype over fossil fuels blah blah blah, and the price of gas, Americans have really cut down on the amount they drive. Which means, that this conservation (which is what the liberals cry that they want, right?) means less gas is purchased. Which means less taxes for the gov't. Which means they now want to think about raising taxes to make up for the loss.  Fucking idiots.</body>
