 <body>I don't know what the big deal was about the Dark Knight, batman's voice was stupid and over done and heath ledger did a horrible job. Im glad he died. Nothing beats Jack Nickolson's performance of the Joker</body>

 <body>how can the role of batman traumatize him enough to take his own life.. having a relationship with another man/kissing/touching (brokebackmt) seems more traumatizing than to be acting crazy as the joker</body>

 <body>  Nicholsan was good for his time, and he created the character the way he saw it would be done for the screen. But Heath reinvented, made it more psychotic, scary and more up to date and more faithful to the original character to the comics</body>
