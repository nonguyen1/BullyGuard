 <body>Wow, you mean corporate CEO's don't like Obama ?  That's almost reason enough to get me to vote for him.  Fuck corporations and their CEO's. This country was built on the back of small business owners, not huge corporate greed.</body>

 <body>Obama to Hit Financially Strapped Plumber with More Taxes  Obama Prepares to Use the Power of Executive Branch to Sqeeze Tax Payers and Redistribute Wealth  Barack Obama told a tax-burdened plumber over the weekend that his economic philosophy is to "spread the wealth around"  Obama made the remark, caught on camera, after fielding some tough questions from the plumber Sunday in Ohio, where the Democratic candidate canvassed neighborhoods and encouraged residents to vote early.  "Your new tax plan is going to tax me more, isn't it?" the plumber asked, complaining that he was being taxed "more and more for fulfilling the American dream."  "It's not that I want to punish your success. I just want to make sure that everybody who is behind you, that they've got a chance for success too," Obama responded. "My attitude is that if the economy's good for folks from the bottom up, it's gonna be good for everybody ... I think when you spread the wealth around, it's good for everybody."   SOURCE:  Obama to Plumber: My Plan Will 'Spread the Wealth Around' Barack Obama tells a plumber in Ohio he wants to "spread the wealth around," eliciting criticism that his economic recovery plan is socialist in nature.
