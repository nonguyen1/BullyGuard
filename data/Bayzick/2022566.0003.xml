 <body>    They are talented, yes, very unique and funny. "Lebowski" is a great comedy, "Raising Arizona" is a favorite of mine, and "Fargo" and "Blood Simple" are also very good. Although I can't say I'll rush to any film they see--I still haven't seen "Man Who Wasn't There, " so I can't really rank all of them--I do think they do very interesting work.    Nonetheless, I don't think there's any WAY you can say they're better than BOTH Martin Scorsese (one of the most talented, Oscar-nominated directors working today, with numerous classics--and classic characters and performances--to his credit), or Stanley Kubrick (who created such classics as "2001, " "Dr. Strangelove, " "Clockwork Orange, " and even to a lesser degree "The Shining"). Both of those directors have multiple films of theirs included on the AFI Top 100, as opposed to just the Coen's "Fargo."    Granted, they're all very different filmmakers trying different forms of storytelling (from the comedy Scorsese and Kubrick did in "King Of Comedy, " "After Hours, " and "Dr. Strangelove, " or the horror of "Cape Fear" or "The Shining, " or Scorsese's period piece "The Age Of Innocence" or Kubrick's sci-fi "2001"), which are almost designed for different audiences (there are some moviegoers who HATE the Coens). Plus, it's difficult to also compare their respective bodies of work too, since Kubrick made films so rarely, and Scorsese himself did a variety of films dealing with criminals. Kubrick is also now dead, and Scorsese is getting long in the tooth himself, although the Coens do probably have another 20 years of filmmaking ahead of them.    But as of right now, going by what they've all accomplished so far, I think you're really going to have a difficult time convincing people that the Coens are the better filmmakers.</body>

 <body>My list is    Miller's Crossing  Fargo  Blood Simple  Big Lebowski  Barton Fink  O Brother Where Art Thou?  Raising Arizona  Intolerable Cruelty      I couldn't watch Hudsucker Proxy and The Man Who Wasn't There felt like a film school student project, all atmosphere and mood. Cruelty just seemed okay, nothing special.    Bill</body>

 <body>        Hey, Im not trying to convince anyone that they're better film makers! I just think they are! Thats the beauty of personal opinion. Their films are just as artistic and intriquate as Kubrick and Scorsese. I dont see how its so inconceivable for me to think they're better.</body>

 <body>    Well yeah, it is really just a matter of personal taste, and I probably should've said as much in my own comment. Personally, I love Kubrick, but I know that there are many people who consider his films cold and impersonal, saying that they just "couldn't get into" them. Certainly I don't like EVERY film he did; his last one "Eyes Wide Shut" left me disappointed. Nonetheless, I think overall he was a master craftsman who tried something different each time. Hell, some people look forward to every Spielberg movie made.    The point I was just making is that all personal opinion or taste aside, bearing in mind what Kubrick and Scorsese accomplished over the course of the last several decades (it's hard to imagine sci-fi films without the influence of "2001, " it's hard to imagine what DeNiro's career would've become if he hadn't made such an impression in "Mean Streets, " or how people like Tarantino would've come into their own without his influence), it's going to be difficult to find many other people who share your opinion that the Coens are the better filmmakers.</body>

 <body>    You're way off the mark pal.    Firstly, Tarantino draws influence from a multitude of film makers. More from the likes of Boorman & DePalma than Scorsese.... but I digress.    There will be plenty of people who share my opinion on the Coens. Like you say Scorsese is responsible for Robert DeNiro's career, likewise the Coens can be considered responsible for Francis McDormand's, John Tuturro, Sam Raimi's, Barry Sonnenfeld's, Holly Hunter's and many more.    They're equally the craftsmen that Scorsese is. Infact, they have a better hit & miss rate than Scorsese. But this is just going to turn into a ping-pong match. Just dont underestimate these fellas.</body>

 <body>    Thats interesting mate, and respect to you for it! What serious flaws would you say are in Barton Fink and I find it very interesting that Blood Simple only gets a "good" ranking and not a "classic" one... :) Next to Fargo, its one of the best examples of film noir there is.</body>
