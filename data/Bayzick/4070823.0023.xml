 <body>  You might not be saying it, but I will. Fool is wrong!  Supply side economics means suppliers make a bundle...you get screwed. "Trickle-down economics" is a lie. The only thing that trickles down is inflation. Putting more money in the hands of the rich leads them to increase their investments, bringing prices out of the reach of the lower and middle classes. Not just for gas, but also for things like housing and health care.</body>

 <body>Heres the three reasons why they've been going down this past week:  -President lifted executive ban on offshore drilling (speculation decreased) -The US is sitting down with Iran (speculation decreased) -Demand has lowered  The cost of a barrel of oil went down 18 dollars this past week, and thats not just the biggest decrease in a week since the war, thats the biggest decrease in history for one week.</body>

 <body>  i don't think you know what you're talking about   wholesale oil prices have come down to some degree  consumer prices are somewhat flexible upward, but strictly  sticky downward; so, gas prices will not fall significantly unless  the decreased demand for it, can be maintained for some time</body>

 <body>  the last time we had gas prices rise, sales of pickup trucks and suvs fell sharply only to pick up again when prices fell. but most people think we aren't gonna see gas in 2 dollar range ever again. why should they reduce the price? the don't have to and nobody seems to know why they are up so high anyhow.</body>

 <body>   If a Democrat becomes President they will raise taxes, causing the cost of fuel to go up. If you know anything about production, you will then know the Government taxes every gallon a gas purchased at the pumps. The Government makes more money off a gallon of fuel that the oil companies.  If they raise taxes, this will probably include the fuel tax, increasing prices of each gallon you pump into your vehicle.</body>
