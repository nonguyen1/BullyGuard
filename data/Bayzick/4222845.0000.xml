 <body>Obama Would Bankrupt the Country in 3 Years  74 % of business leaders say they fear that an Obama presidency would be disastrous for the country.  "The stakes for this presidential election are higher than they've ever been in recent memory," said Edward M. Kopko, CEO and Publisher of Chief Executive magazine. "We've been experiencing consecutive job losses for nine months now. There's no doubt that reviving the job market will be a top priority for the incoming president. And job creating CEOs repeatedly tell us that McCain's policies are far more conducive to a more positive employment environment than Obama's."  "I'm not terribly excited about McCain being president, but I'm sure that Obama, if elected, will have a negative impact on business and the economy," said one CEO voicing his lack of enthusiasm for either candidate, but particularly Obama.  In expressing their rejection of Senator Obama, some CEOs who responded to the survey went as far as to say that "some of his programs would bankrupt the country within three years, if implemented." In fact, the poll highlights that Obama's tax policies, which scored the lowest grade in the poll, are particularly unpopular among CEOs.  "Overall, many CEOs are concerned about the future of the U.S. economy and its ability to compete in the global market, but they look to John McCain and hope that this self-described political maverick may yet shake up established thinking and not give into to the tired policies of the past," concluded Kopko.

 <body>Wow, you mean corporate CEO's don't like Obama ?  That's almost reason enough to get me to vote for him.  Fuck corporations and their CEO's. This country was built on the back of small business owners, not huge corporate greed.</body>

 <body>Obama to Hit Financially Strapped Plumber with More Taxes  Obama Prepares to Use the Power of Executive Branch to Sqeeze Tax Payers and Redistribute Wealth  Barack Obama told a tax-burdened plumber over the weekend that his economic philosophy is to "spread the wealth around"  Obama made the remark, caught on camera, after fielding some tough questions from the plumber Sunday in Ohio, where the Democratic candidate canvassed neighborhoods and encouraged residents to vote early.  "Your new tax plan is going to tax me more, isn't it?" the plumber asked, complaining that he was being taxed "more and more for fulfilling the American dream."  "It's not that I want to punish your success. I just want to make sure that everybody who is behind you, that they've got a chance for success too," Obama responded. "My attitude is that if the economy's good for folks from the bottom up, it's gonna be good for everybody ... I think when you spread the wealth around, it's good for everybody."   SOURCE:  Obama to Plumber: My Plan Will 'Spread the Wealth Around' Barack Obama tells a plumber in Ohio he wants to "spread the wealth around," eliciting criticism that his economic recovery plan is socialist in nature.
