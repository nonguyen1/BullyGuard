 <body>So basically, he's saying what? That he can't hire people in this country to do with the jobs? Even with the tech visa program? Bullshit. And those support jobs? Guess where they're going? Yup, to India. He may hire tech support people, but they're in a support center in India. Either taht or they are temporary contract workers.  You did realize that he is the reason that companies won't keep a temp worker past a certain time, right? Because gates fired all his hourly non-exempt staff, then hired them back as contract workers? He kept them for years as contract workers. The only difference was that now, he didn' t have to pay benefits or give them the stock options that he had promised them when he hired them as regular workers. The workers sued and won.</body>

 <body>  Ours hasn't progressed that badly. Secondary and College is free, University can be done via a special loan from Gov. So theres no money restricting someone if they want to go Uni. We open our colleges to Europeans and immigrants who are hard working tbh, but then you hear the small amount of British complaining how immigrants are "stealing jobs" (when immigrants do it better)</body>

 <body>In spite of what gates has to say Co. can pay HB-1 employees less than they would pay an American grad I know several that weren't able to get work so went into other fields now CEOs want to complain maybe they should hire cits first instead of paying att. to tell them how not to.</body>
