0,"i just have to say that is the coolest freaking kids costume ever. although it looks like he had a bit too much milk plus.i saw it when i was like 15. i think back and love the concept of the movie but i think i like it more now that im a little smartergreat film.one of the best films i ever viddied.great fucking movie!! one of the best ever.great movie. very unique!friggin awesome flick. loved the shining too. and even though the story was kinda boring, barry lyndon was a gorgeous flick. first half of full metal jacket was cool too.it's an incredible film. stanley kubrick is surely one of the greatest filmmakers of all-time. i would place him above welles, godard, dreyer, bergman, fellini and bunuel, and that's saying quite a bit.stanley kubrick, and seeing ""clockwork orange"" as a teenager were what made me start to study film as a potential art form, not just the hollywood products shoved into release dates that i was used to up until that point (and that, more and more, movies tend towards now). it was just so unique and powerful, and in a way, through its own antisocial nature, it gave me the strength to get through those uncertain high school years, where i often felt caged up and institutionalized like alex. a lot of people didn't understand it, wrote it off as too weird or disturbing (which it is, certainly was at the time, though times have changed), but then it's not meant to be a family film. i wrote like 2 papers on it in college.    although i for one think filmmakers are far too casual with releasing special edition dvd versions of movies these days, there's one movie where it'd be really nice to see just that, so we might have something with promotional materials and essays and documentaries detailing its influence and transition to the screen, and with any luck, a commentary by malcolm mcdowell and jan harlan detailing their thoughts about it, and kubrick himself (rip, stan).another fan here.    i even dressed like alex last saturday.        indeed."

0,"i enjoy his films, most are action films but lock stock is my favorite of all.lock, stock and two smoking barrels  what a movie! the ending is too much, meaning i liked it.i agree on the typecast and the agent.thought about this over dinner and i think maybe the action films do suit him. he can say a lot with the expression on his face and his movies aren't slowed down by a lot of dialogue. i don't necessary like all the hand to hand combat but i can tolerate it because i know he'll win and look good doing it.watched this movie 2 x's in 4 days liked it. in 1971 london, a car dealer and his gang of thieves break into a bank vault and find far more than cash and jewelry. saffron burrows plays a good role in this action crime drama thriller. based on a true story. one of the largest heist in history. f.y.i.- it came to the cinemas on friday, march 7th, 2008 not the 9thhe's great. i loved him in war, which would have been an awesome movie if the ending wasn't such a fail.nice to know there are others out there who like him too.that new guy ritchie movie he was in ""revolver"" is soooooo good. sure again statham is a tough guy, but it sheds here in this movie. i used to say lock stock was his best role but revolver now is really his best work.cool it's on the list for todays d.v.d.'s to find. it's on dvd right?yes ma'am and to be honest, it's a buy. you'll really love this movie since you're a statham fan"

""we were chatting about our last fishing trip. it was one in the morning. i began to film a bit with my mobile phone while the others were chatting and joking.  ""suddenly we heard something - a weird noise as if someone was throwing stones.

""this is no joke. we are still afraid to go out - just like everyone else in the neighborhood now.  ""one of my friends was so scared after seeing that thing that we had to take him to the hospital.""   last october two workers on belgrano railway line in buenos aires reported seeing a ""strange and tiny figure"". they claim the figure appeared at night, threw stones at them then ran away leaving a 'vapour trail' that 'burned the grass'.1 of 1  enlarge this image, taken by an argentinan teenager on his mobile, shows what appears to be a gnome-like figure walking a field.   what the fuck is this thing?i say that the whole thing is a fucking stunt which the kids in the video may or may not be in on and that 'the gnome' is some midget or child with a pointed hat.it loks like midget to me.  move along, nothing to see here folks.  next!"

0,"i have noticed after reading some accounts from posters on these boards how much a priori reasoning has again imposed itself on the thinking of many people.  some are equivocating who is the instigator/offender/offensive element and who is on the reactionary/defender element of this conflict.  those who are skeptical of the surge and iraqi progress contend that it is the mahdi army who is on the offensive, when in fact it is the opposite...the isf is on the offensive to assert its control of the country.  like it is said in the article above, there cannot be two militaries...it's either an iraqi army or the mahdi army.  everyone who cares about the fate of the people in iraq to live in a free society will put their chips and support behind the iraqi army.  who among the presidential candidates is most or least likely to do so?on the next episode of ""as iraq turns...""that's very machiavelian. can't have another prince's army running amok in your territory.it's purely machiavelian...during a cease-fire no less. it's a play out of the prince playbook.within the next 4 months we'll all see just how meaningless the 'surge' was.all these things are great, but we are not allowed to chase them into iran and fix the rest of the pack..no. that's going too far. expel them from iraq, let someone else deal with them. all we have to do is get a secure iraq for now. i think i under estimated the iraqi government's... ruthless efficiency.i bet within the next 4 months we'll have almost no mahdi army left and sadr will be captured/killed or ""studying and praying"", no politics. remember, a few weeks ago he issued one statement saying that he wants ""to drop out of politics"", i think it won't take much time for us to see another similar declaration issued by him.. i just hope our guys will keep doing what they are doing now!..i think he is reaching for an epiphany of non-violent protest. i wish him god's speed on that epiphany before the fighting gets worse.maybe you are right, i think they won't get a warm welcome in iran if they fail to keep basra. the isf need to seal the border completely and we are needed there to help them.."

0,"ok batman, you make a good point. so before i leave the country, what can we do to keep free market, fix the economy, fix the dollar, and over all fix mother liberty. what is the solution.back in 2000 it was a republican controlled supreme court, which of course changes from time to time. but still the point has been made. why does a suprem power possibly influened by one party or the other party make and decide who is to be in charge of our country. why not a re-vote or a boxing match. or something.k. now here is my stance on it all. i think if 1 is legal the other has to be. simply because they are the same thing in concept: cheap labor for an advantage in a market, less input for the same output. i'm not necessarily for both, but i do think that if companies can go offshore, then companies who can't afford to (despite the industry) should be able to higher cheap labor.  the problem with socialism is that government controlling wages will lead to lack of effort because of the lack of benefits. right now, people work hard and continue to work hard to work their way up that ladder, with socialism, you don't get the same kind of purpose, or drive, from the workers. what we have now, isn't a real capitalism because no matter what, the gov't still watches for monopolies and still regulates a base point in wages (minimum wages).  i would prefer a capitalistic market over a socialistic market any day of the week because it benefits the hard working man who strives to climb the ladder.hell if i knew then i would do something. i do not know. i do not know what to do in life. i just want to be free. not haveing to be enslaved or watch our mother liberyt by raped dried by those child-raping politicians who are destroying our beloved nation. what can we do?how do you know my name? that is not listed. i do not even have it anywhere on thiis computer or my email address. holy shit you are from the government.the supreme court is completely independent, and was designed that way. the only time that any partisanship has an influence is when the confirmations are taking place.  so tell me, how exactly can any president, party, or politician have any influence over a member in the supreme court? what can they do? the justice is nominated for life. what could any party or politician possibly offer to a sitting supreme court justice, when that justice has a guaranteed job no matter who's in power, and no matter what their decision is?  think about the 2000 election for a second. what did the justices who voted to stop the recount (let's remember that the case wasn't about the supreme court voting for one candidate or another....if you really think that, please reread the decision) have to gain from doing so? what motive could justice scalia and then chief justice rehnquist possibly have in ensuring that one party or another, or one president or another, came to power? do you know what would have happened to all the sitting ""conservative"" justices if gore had won instead? nothing. so how did the party have any influence over their decision?to seth: i looked up the 2000 supreme court judges and most of them were placed on the bench by republican presidents meaning that they swung towards bush. now the bench has some new people. but all in all one still must be weary of such a system. a system that can almost if given the power to do so or by themselves with the protection of the military decide who can live or die in this country by simple declarations. it is complicated. not one government or political system is perfect. i understand that.my point is my country is not perfect but is going to rapidly change in the blink of an eye and freedom here will die. and i am not too sure how to live life anymore? i sent you a message to your myspace page on a private matter. that will help clear my mind in what i want to do in life. because i am not too sure on how to live life or what too do.batman: yeah saint michael is my pic. you scared me there for a moment. i do not mind living such a simple life. i have though about it. but i have feel that i meant to live for so much more. how can one achieve when all the odds and your own country is stacked against you. i am trying, my god i am trying yet i still have not reached the promised land. eventually i will find peace within my mind i do hope so.nereverine: you do not know my suffering. i have nothing left in this world. i have one last shot. my purpose is simply give ideas(inventions of all kinds) to your government. they test them out, and if they work then i think i will have a new job. but what is the price that i am going to be paying."

seeking compensation. his claim was turned down last march because the statute of limitations had expired. but aslin intends to fight on. if a higher court accepts his appeal, the consequences could be far-reaching. for fred aslin and his siblings were not an isolated case.  from 1907 onward, at least 60,000 americans were sterilized against their will. the legal basis for these forced sterilizations was provided by so-called eugenics laws. most compulsory sterilizations occurred in the 1930s and '40s, but some states, such as virginia, continued the practice until the late 1970s. most of the victims were poor and members of minorities, and none of them received compensation, according to paul lombardo, professor of law and bioethics at the university of virginia. a strong eugenics movement in the usa it is not widely known that there was a strong eugenics movement not only in germany, but in the usa as well. the doctrine, hatched in the second half of the 19th century, combined elements of social darwinism with the mendelian theory of heredity. its advocates pushed for perfecting the human ""gene pool"" by influencing the reproductive process. their ongoing attempts at achieving a ""perfect"" society included aggressive - and in the case of the nazis, murderous - actions against marginal groups and minorities.  american scientists played a vanguard role in the eugenics movement, which also had its supporters in scandinavia, latin america and japan. u.s. biologists like charles b. davenport and harry h. laughlin advocated keeping the ""anglo-american race"" pure. their premise was that most ailments, as well as such social problems as poverty and criminality, were hereditary in nature. therefore persons with a ""good genetic makeup"" should be encouraged to have families, while ""inferior"" people of allegedly poor genetic stock should be prevented from reproducing. among those people regarded as inferior were epileptics, manic-depressives, prostitutes, alcoholics, the homeless and criminals. under the eugenics laws, people who came to the negative attention of the social authorities could be branded as ""feeble-minded"" by court order and legally forced to undergo steriliziation. a model for the nazis by the early 1930s, some 30 american states had adopted eugenics laws. most of them were modeled after the law which harry h. laughlin had drafted for the state of virginia in 1924. that legislation found emulators outside the united states too. for example, it served germany's national socialists as a model for their 1933 ""law for protection against genetically defective offspring,"" on the basis of which at least 400,000 men and women were forcibly sterilized. more than 200,000 handicapped or allegedly handicapped people were also murdered by the nazis. the university of heidelberg was apparently so grateful to eugenicist laughlin that it awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1936 for his ""services on behalf of racial hygiene.""  in 1927, the u.s. supreme court affirmed the constitutionality of virginia's sterilization law. this was followed by a swift rise in the number of forced sterilizations in the united states. american eugenicists also pushed for anti-immigration measures and stricter laws to prevent racially mixed marriages. in a speech to the u.s. congress, laughlin had argued that ""morally and intellectually inferior"" immigrants from eastern and southern europe were polluting america's genetic potential. the 1924 immigration restriction act reduced by two thirds the immigration quotas for people from those parts of europe. in signing the new law, president calvin coolidge said: ""america must remain american."" pseudo-science at universities for a time, the doctrine of eugenics exerted considerable influence on american society. based largely on political and social prejudices, the pseudo-science was taught at schools and universities. leading institutions, such as harvard, cornell and columbia, offered courses in eugenics. prominent industrialists like cornflakes magnate j. h. kellogg supported the creation of eugenics groups and organizations. so-called fitter family contests were held at country fairs, with citizens parading their ""good genes."" movies like ""the black stork"" propagated eugenic sterilization.  during the 1940s, however, the theory of eugenics came under increasing criticism because of its racial prejudices and its lack of scientific foundation. most american sterilization laws were abandoned during the 1950s. in 1980, former psychiatric patients who had been forced into sterilization banded together for a class-action suit, demanding compensation from the state of virginia. but a federal judge rejected their suit on the grounds that the u.s. supreme court had affirmed the constitutionality of sterilization back in 1927. that supreme court ruling was never fought, even in subsequent years.

sterilizations was provided by so-called eugenics laws. most compulsory sterilizations occurred in the 1930s and '40s, but some states, such as virginia, continued the practice until the late 1970s. most of the victims were poor and members of minorities, and none of them received compensation, according to paul lombardo, professor of law and bioethics at the university of virginia. a strong eugenics movement in the usa it is not widely known that there was a strong eugenics movement not only in germany, but in the usa as well. the doctrine, hatched in the second half of the 19th century, combined elements of social darwinism with the mendelian theory of heredity. its advocates pushed for perfecting the human ""gene pool"" by influencing the reproductive process. their ongoing attempts at achieving a ""perfect"" society included aggressive - and in the case of the nazis, murderous - actions against marginal groups and minorities.  american scientists played a vanguard role in the eugenics movement, which also had its supporters in scandinavia, latin america and japan. u.s. biologists like charles b. davenport and harry h. laughlin advocated keeping the ""anglo-american race"" pure. their premise was that most ailments, as well as such social problems as poverty and criminality, were hereditary in nature. therefore persons with a ""good genetic makeup"" should be encouraged to have families, while ""inferior"" people of allegedly poor genetic stock should be prevented from reproducing. among those people regarded as inferior were epileptics, manic-depressives, prostitutes, alcoholics, the homeless and criminals. under the eugenics laws, people who came to the negative attention of the social authorities could be branded as ""feeble-minded"" by court order and legally forced to undergo steriliziation. a model for the nazis by the early 1930s, some 30 american states had adopted eugenics laws. most of them were modeled after the law which harry h. laughlin had drafted for the state of virginia in 1924. that legislation found emulators outside the united states too. for example, it served germany's national socialists as a model for their 1933 ""law for protection against genetically defective offspring,"" on the basis of which at least 400,000 men and women were forcibly sterilized. more than 200,000 handicapped or allegedly handicapped people were also murdered by the nazis. the university of heidelberg was apparently so grateful to eugenicist laughlin that it awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1936 for his ""services on behalf of racial hygiene.""  in 1927, the u.s. supreme court affirmed the constitutionality of virginia's sterilization law. this was followed by a swift rise in the number of forced sterilizations in the united states. american eugenicists also pushed for anti-immigration measures and stricter laws to prevent racially mixed marriages. in a speech to the u.s. congress, laughlin had argued that ""morally and intellectually inferior"" immigrants from eastern and southern europe were polluting america's genetic potential. the 1924 immigration restriction act reduced by two thirds the immigration quotas for people from those parts of europe. in signing the new law, president calvin coolidge said: ""america must remain american."" pseudo-science at universities for a time, the doctrine of eugenics exerted considerable influence on american society. based largely on political and social prejudices, the pseudo-science was taught at schools and universities. leading institutions, such as harvard, cornell and columbia, offered courses in eugenics. prominent industrialists like cornflakes magnate j. h. kellogg supported the creation of eugenics groups and organizations. so-called fitter family contests were held at country fairs, with citizens parading their ""good genes."" movies like ""the black stork"" propagated eugenic sterilization.  during the 1940s, however, the theory of eugenics came under increasing criticism because of its racial prejudices and its lack of scientific foundation. most american sterilization laws were abandoned during the 1950s. in 1980, former psychiatric patients who had been forced into sterilization banded together for a class-action suit, demanding compensation from the state of virginia. but a federal judge rejected their suit on the grounds that the u.s. supreme court had affirmed the constitutionality of sterilization back in 1927. that supreme court ruling was never fought, even in subsequent years. as a result, future damage claims have little prospect of success. and the victims of eugenic forced sterilization have no lobbying power to achieve out-of-court settlements.  two current exhibits are

documents titled ""polluting the pure."" and the cold springs harbor laboratory, a genetics research institute in the state of new york, is featuring an online exhibit on the history of the american

[if you're reading this story because of a link from the huffpost or fark.com, i've updated my reporting here. it looks like clinton did rake in $10m as of sometime late yesterday, based on a claimed total of 100,000 donations since tuesday night.}"
0,"white house: north korea assisted syria on nuclear reactor destroyed by israel   white house: syria must 'come clean' about nukes (2:27 min.)  web extra: u.s. intel video cites n.k., syria link (11:50 min.)  bush administration opens up about israeli airstrike on syrian reactor washington (cbs news)  the white house said thursday that north korea's secret work on anuclear reactor with syria was ""a dangerous and potentiallydestabilizing development for the world,"" raising doubts aboutpyongyang's intention to carry through with a promised disclosure ofits nuclear activities.  sevenmonths after israel bombed the reactor, the white house broke itssilence and said north korea assisted syria's secret nuclear programand that the destroyed facility was not intended for ""peacefulpurposes.""  the disclosure could undermine six-party negotiationsto try to resolve the nuclear standoff with north korea. the whitehouse issued a two-page statement after lawmakers were given detailsabout the reactor in a series of briefings on capitol hill. the whitehouse said the international atomic energy agency also was beingbriefed on the intelligence.  while calling north korea's nuclearassistance to syria a ""dangerous manifestation"" of pyongyang's nuclearweapons program and its proliferation activities, the u.s. said itremained committed to the talks.  the administration said that after the reactor was damaged beyond repair, syria tried to bury evidence of its existence.  ""thiscover-up only served to reinforce our confidence that this reactor wasnot intended for peaceful activities,"" white house press secretary danaperino said. ""the syrian regime must come clean before the worldregarding its illicit nuclear activities.""  cia director michaelhayden, director of national intelligence mike mcconnell and nationalsecurity adviser stephen hadley briefed lawmakers, who were shown avideo presentation of intelligence information that the administrationcontends establishes a strong link between north korea's nuclearprogram and the bombed syrian site. it included still photographs thatshowed a strong resemblance between specific features of the plant andthe one near yongbyon.  according to officials familiar with thepresentation, it did not show moving images inside the facility or anynorth korean workers, but included photographs that depict similaritiesbetween the north korean and syrian reactor designs.  u.s.negotiators have been trying hard to close a deal in which north koreawould admit to and give up all its nuclear activities in return forbeing taken off the list of countries that support terrorism, reportscbs news national security correspondent david martin.  but atthe same time, the administration had all the photos showing northkorea was secretly helping syria build a reactor that could produceplutonium for nuclear weapons, adds martin. the images include a photothat u.s. intelligence says shows the head of syria's nuclear agencywith one of the north koreans who was negotiating with the unitedstates.  by making the photos public, martin reports, the u.s. istelling north korea: ""if you won't come clean, we'll come clean foryou.""  the syrian nuclear reactor destroyed by israeli jets waswithin weeks or months of being functional, a top u.s. official toldthe associated press, speaking on condition of anonymity because of thesensitivity of the matter. the official said the facility was mostlycompleted but still needed significant testing before it could bedeclared operational.  no uranium, which is needed to fuel areactor, was evident at the site, a remote area of eastern syria alongthe euphrates river. but the u.s. official said the reactor was similarin design to a north korean reactor at yongbyon, which has in the pastproduced small amounts of plutonium, the marterial needed to makepowerful nuclear weapons.  top members of the house intelligencecommittee said the reactor posed a serious threat of spreadingdangerous nuclear materials.  ""this is a serious proliferationissue, both for the middle east and the countries that may be involvedin asia,"" said rep. pete hoekstra, r-mich.  hoekstra andintelligence committee chairman silvestre reyes, d-texas, toldreporters after the closed meeting that they were angry that the bushadministration had delayed briefing the full committee for eight months.  ""it'sbad management and terrible public policy to go for eight monthsknowing this was out there and then drop this in our laps six hoursbefore they go to the public,"" hoekstra said.  president bush'sfailure to keep congress informed has created friction that may imperilcongressional support for bush's policies toward north korea and syria,he said.  ""it totally breaks down any trust that you have betweenthe administration and congress,"" hoekstra said. ""i think it reallyjeopardizes any type of the agreement they may come up with"" regardingnorth korea.  a senior administration said the white house wentpublc with the evidence now to prevent an even broader confrontation inthe middle east region, reports cbs news white house correspondent markknoller.  ""we feared that if knowledge of this event spread quickly syria might feel greater pressure to react,"" the official said.  the white house also stressed that north korea's assistance on the syrian reactor was an issue of ""great international concern.""  ""theconstruction of this reactor was a dangerous and potentiallydestabilizing development for the region and the world,"" perino said inthe statement. ""this is particularly true because it was done covertlyand in violation of the very procedures designed to reassure the worldof the peaceful intent of nuclear activities.  ""the united statescalls upon the international community to redouble our common effortsto ending these activities and preventing the spread of weapons of massdestruction in this critical region.""you mean like north korea ""came clean""?why come clean,, iraq came clean with inspectors and they submitted every bit of evidence with a 1000 pages that it was not in pocession of wmds, yet it was meaningless in the goal to invade the sovereign nation anyway. this come clean nonsense is all political rhedoric to appease stupid people who support policies of an aggressive preemtive nature and dont want the truth.i think the white house need to ""come clean"" about nukes first.pete:  i have had discussions with one of the iraqi inspectors - who is fluent in arabic. he is fluent enough that he gets paid to do translations. he is also a friend of a close friend.  he said that iraq did have wmd's, that they hid information, that they had spies int he inspection teams, that they knew when the inspectors were coming. inspectors would be held up at one gate and could watch convoys of trucks leave at another gate.  the truth in syria is that north korea was working with syria to build nukes - in contravention of their agreement with the u.s. not to do so in return for fuel supplies. that agreement was worked out by one jimmy carter under the auspices of the clinton administration. the north koreans later admitted that they violated the treaty from the very beginning."

 the emphasis isn't on quality anymore. it's on quantity.  there will be 100 movies, big and small, coming out this summer of 2008. that's just a four month period (may-august). consider how many movies come out per year (in the u.s.) and this is proof the focus is now on market saturation and not the quality of the product. also, consider over half (50%) of those movies released each year are remakes and or based on previously proven properties like novels and comic books.  studios can get away with this approach because a lot of these movies aren't made for very much, so when they do strike b.o. gold -- like ""juno"" -- they can maximize the profits.  most of your smaller movies have budgets of less than $40 million which is why they can afford to fail at the b.o. because they will easily make that back through dvd rentals. these days, there are only a few, tent pole pictures studios are willing to sink a lot of money ($100-$300 million per picture) into. these are your franchise pictures like the household comic book movies, high concept stuff like ""transformers"" etc. -- properties that coincidentally also have cross-promotional tie-ins (toys, video games, fast food, cell phone, etc.) to help finance the films.  it is this emphasis on quantity that is effecting what is produced, movies don't have to be ""good"" anymore. they just have to be on the market and interest you in the dvd. because once you buy or rent the dvd, even if the movie ""sucks"" you've already spent your money and that is what the studios and theater owners want.  but to say all movies are garbage this decade is pure idiocy. this decade has seen many future classics in their respected genres...from all around the world."

1,"tue jun 3, 5:00 pm et    ottawa (reuters) - u.s. soldiers who have deserted the military because of the war in iraq should be allowed to stay permanently in canada, the house of commons voted in a nonbinding motion on tuesday.  advertisement  the three opposition parties, which together hold a majority of seats in the house, backed a motion that said the government should allow conscientious objectors and their families ""who have refused or left military service related to a war not sanctioned by the united nations"" to stay in canada.  canada was a haven for tens of thousands of draft dodgers during the vietnam war and has attracted an estimated 175 to 200 americans who are resisting the iraq conflict.  ""i think canada has always been a place which has welcomed those who seek peace and seek freedom,"" bob rae, foreign affairs spokesman for the main opposition liberal party, told reporters outside the commons after the vote.  the minority conservative government opposes the idea, arguing that, unlike during the vietnam war, the current u.s. military is composed of volunteers, and also that washington allows people to apply for conscientious objector status.  ""people do not join with their eyes closed. if they do, then they have their own problems,"" conservative member of parliament laurie hawn, a retired lieutenant colonel in the canadian air force, said during debate on the motion.  the supreme court of canada refused last november to hear appeals of two u.s. deserters whose applications for refugee status had been turned down by immigration authorities.

""twenty tanker trucks escorted by the regional police left an industrial zone this morning for barcelona port to help supply and distribute to petrol stations in the region,"" a regional police spokesman told afp. forty percent of petrol stations in catalonia have run out of fuel, according to manuel amado, president of the catalonia federation of service stations. arrivals of fresh meat, fish and fruit in madrid have come to a near halt, according to officials at the mercamadrid market, spain's biggest wholesale market. they said that fish would be in short supply from thursday but stocks of other foods should last until the end of the week. automakers in spain said most of the country's automobile plants, including those of nissan, mercedes benz, seat and renault, have had to cut or halt production. auto plants are particularly vulnerable to a strike by hauliers, which provide them with spare parts. truckers stopped lorries from crossing the french-spain border and caused major tailbacks around major spanish cities, including madrid, barcelona and valencia. spanish and french truckers staged pickets on either side of the frontier between the two countries. they blocked a bridge on the border at bidassoa in the western basque region and other main crossing points. on the french side, service areas on motorways were packed with trucks from the border right back to bordeaux, about 200 kilometres (125 miles) away. spain's second largest hauliers' union fenadismer, which claims to represent 70,000 out of spain's 380,000 truck drivers, launched an open-ended strike on monday. talks monday between the hauliers and the government ended in failure, fenadismer said. the portuguese government said it hoped to have an agreement with its truckers by the end of the week. a separate strike by workers at the french rail company, sncf, severely hit rail traffic. about half of intercity and local commuter trains were running along with about three quarters of tgv high speed trains from paris to southwest france. some express commuter lines into paris were badly affected by the strike. spanish fisherman were keeping up their strike against fuel prices but most french trawlers have decided to go back to work after several weeks of blocking ports and access to oil refineries.with the food shortage, the closing of the borders, the massive floods in the north of spain & basque country, the crisis in spain is escalating.since fuel costs about twice as much in europe as in the u.s., since oil has a world-wide price and the cost of refining is about the same everywhere, the difference is taxes.  perhaps the socialist governments should reduce some fo the taxes in an aeffort to not destroy their own countries.  and if you think prices are high now, just wait until iran gets their nukes working (something that i notice the leftists think they should do.)ironic latin america & europe have better relations with the arabs then americans but the price of oil is higher, but its high all around now thanks to the us war in iraq & afghanistan.give it a couple of years and people will stop going to work.  because they cannot afford to.dont under-estimate public transporation (buses) & the motorcycle. the liscense & the gas for that is cheaper.i think this is a temporary problem, once the government negotiates with the union it will be taken care of, the lesson will be learned.i got me a little 125cc bike at the moment. i put £5 in it and it does 100 miles or so.  i use it instead of my car at the moment. the car does 100 miles on about £14.  i think the future is mopeds.better for the enviornment too.i would say that 99% of people don't give two shits about the environment. if petrol was cheap, i would have an american muscle car.  as it is, i use my suzuki marauder to cruise about.  and that is so in america, you love your big old dumb cars."

0,"unfortunatly everything that is adapted into a movie has alot missing theres threads on x-men,hulk etc. what i will give bay credit for is that he kept the movie with a real sense of aww, watching them transform was very incredible even though they were different very aesthetically pleasing and fun..it was a fun movie to watch and i enjoyedi do like bay's style when it comes to action. the transformation scenes made me a little dizzy, they were too close up at times. but he does have a knack for action.i forgot to add, that i hope they fix all these problems in part 2.i hate everything about that fucking movie.  it ruined transformers for me.i was never a transformers fan, and i still hated the movie.the cgi action in the movie rocked me. michael bay will always suck but thats what people are into. damn, optimus was really gay for humans. he was ""ill die for you guys!"".i'm sure the next movie will expand on starscream's personality.  if not, too bad.i still think that michael bay focused on the humans more than the transformers.  it was almost as if the robots were just thrown in as eye candy.i liked the transformers movie..loved it in fact and i literally grew up on the transformers. i thought it told a good story and the action was tight my only complaint is the transformations looked too complicated..there was too many parts n shit movin for me..i think if they had kept the transforming a little closer to the cartoon it would have been perfect..another complaint i have is megatron n starscream was fuckin ugly..they could have made starscream look a little like he did in the cartoon at least and megatron was just plain ass ugly if he comes back in part 2 or 3 maybe they will have him actually scan a jet or somethin to turn into like the rest of em didall hail to the mighty starscream!!!!!! lol"

""i'm sorry my actions caused you pain. i hope this brings you the closure that you seek. never harbor hate,"" medellin said to those gathered to watch him die. ""never harbor hate.""  in nuevo laredo, mexico, where medellin was born, a small group of his relatives condemned the execution.  ""this is another murder because no one has the right to take someone else's life, only god,"" said medellin's cousin reyna armendariz.  a large black bow and a banner that read ""no to the death penalty ... may god forgive you,"" hung from an iron fence in the front of the house where medellin lived before moving to the united states at the age of 3.  armendariz said the family hopes medellin's body would be return to mexico.  ""he signed a paper saying he wanted his remains to go to a friend. who knows if they will bring him here,"" armendariz said sobbing.  the mexican government statement said officials ""were concerned for the precedent that (the execution) may create for the rights of mexican nationals who may be detained in that country.""  an international court ruled in 2004 that the convictions of medellin and 50 other mexicans on death row around the united states violated the vienna convention, which calls for people arrested abroad to have access to their home country's consular officials.  texas state officials say medellin didn't ask to do so until well after he was convicted of capital murder.  the international court of justice, also known as the world court, said the mexican prisoners should have new court hearings to determine whether the violation affected their cases.  president bush asked states to review the cases, but the u.s. supreme court ruled earlier this year neither the president nor the international court can force texas to wait.i think the precedent is obvious. don't do capital crime. it's not that hard to understand.i read that story this morning.... i might, just might, understand if the accused had been here a short time, but this fella came to america when he was 3, has been here 30 years. i'm quite sure, he does not need a mexican consulate explaining to him our laws.yeah, well he is getting some laws explained to him now, ones he should have known all along.that piece of filth got what he deserved! all these far-lefft loons have gone crazy, they care more about the killer than about the victim. they will never remember the two girls he raped and killed.i don't know what disgusts me more...  the fact that the bastard raped those two girls, the fact that he hypocritcally preached against hatred (he deserved it for what he did to those poor girls), or the fact that the mexican government is basically endorsing his crimes.  hear me illegal aliens, look, if you're so determined why don't you overthrow the assholes in charge of mexico and make it a better place to live? or do you condone these heinous actions yourself?  seriously anyone who defends these bastards should themselves be put in jail. he is just lucky i wasn't there. he meaning both the rapist and the government official.""nobody has the right to take another...""  he took two lives! two! and here he is saying that his cousin is worth more than the two girls he strangled and violated?  sorry the statement of the cousin just pissed me off enough to warrant its own rant.""texas executed medellin, 33, late tuesday for the 1993 rape and killing of two teenage girls in houston.""

0,"they got people for that.well ""they"" have ""people"" for everything...so why even care who gets elected? lets just vote in a retarded paraplegic cat. or to quote burroughs, ""a$$hole doesn't know what buttons to push or what happens when you push them"" seriously here we have a guy who can pass laws to that effect the internet and doesn't even know how to get on it and i'm willing to bet he can't find the power button on his computer either, but we got people for that. i would just like to think that who ever gets elected is a bit worldly, a renaissance man or woman if you will and so living in our tech driven world understand something about it. its not like i'm asking for the president to be some macrovision drm breaker, just to at least know how to get online.hahahaha. this thread is funny.indeed they do. you're never seen a puter in the oval office.  but you'd have to expect that anyone who is the least bit curious about anything, and wants to see what's really out there besides what is digested by staff, would have a desktop in the private office off the oval. alsoa desktop for notes, e-mail, and writing, especially while in transit.  you would expect that with it so critical to the economy and national security, the commander-in-chief would have at least a nodding acquaintance with hacks, viruses, broadband, and such.  he should also know that cert is not a breath mint.  if there is a generation gap between the majority of the people and senator mccain, this is another tellingexample.  and if this is just a continuation of the incuriosity, inattention, and vincible ignorance of the current president, so much the worse.  ""what color is the red phone?"" -- george w. bushanother reason why a rock would make a better president than mclame.thats crazy talk iam sure mccaine knows how to run basic programs and the internet,you younger people in your twentys that grew up on computers have a hard time beleaving that some people as old as mccaine probably dont really have a want or need for computers.i know his daughter is the one who runs his election site. i have met alot young of people that dont like pcs and really have a desire to use them. if an executive of a major corperation asks for a document or information, do you really think hes going to sit down at a pc and get it himself? or make one of the people they pay to do it?.have you ever been in a ceo's office? or a vp's office?  why not visit one soon?when the information is on a shared drive or within grasp of their computer for them to get? well ever executive i have known has done so. when it is down the hall being typed by his secretary on a royal typewriter, than no, they do usually send for it...or they send an *gasp* and email asking if someone could email them back the document·which in mccains case he would have to get his wife to come in and help him withwow. a blast from the past. i remember typewriters.  for skool i had a smith-corona and then an olympia portable, plus one of the first selectrics, ensconced in student publications offices. the skool paper set its type every night on justowriters, which were almost as noisy as pavement breakers.  in my first job i had a remington manual, then an olympia manual with moreenameled sheet steel than a small fridge.  in the next job, everyone had ibm selectrics.  thendown the chain to an ibm executive, with type bars.  the next shop had correcting selectrics, until the owner bought me a decmate for christmas.  then secretaries became an endangered species.  and middle-aged, highly placed people had to learn how to type.  my heart bled for them.where i work i get a ton of old people that wont use the ""self check"" at the damn grocery because they think its stupid and to hard to learn. when all you do is press a button and the machine tells you what to do next.  an executive of a large copration wouldnt have their job if they didnt know how to use a computer unless they own a lot of stock in the company."

0,"most boys/men i know seem to think that women are inherently inferior...i think men and women are mostly equal, but woman usually don't have as much power as men because of three things:   1: woman are more likely to have less time to gain rank, they spend more time on education, family, etc. and they spend more money, money = time lost.  2: woman are less likely to use force in order to get what they want.  3: woman care about other peoples' feelings too much, they are less likely to get rid of people who are in their way.  basically the percentage of woman who ""play nice"" is higher than the percentage of men who do. also they focus on education more than men. (the education system actually tends to hold people back in life --- it's hard to prove due to the fact that the corporations think otherwise, without corp./gov. backing it would be obvious though.)i don't believe that women and men are equal, it is something women are still trying to strive towards this very day.  i don't think it is a matter of time, education or ""playing nice"" but rather lack of experience and setting a higher bar for oneself (demand more). women need to be more demanding and stand up for what they believe in. there is nothing wrong with having your voice heard or making a man serve you.  in ancient times it was a common thing to have men for slaves, ones that worshipped their goddess. by demanding more from men and holding that power that we truly have but have lost over time (threw greedy white men) it is a matter of regaining and utilizing what we have inside of us.  being in control doesn't always have to be associated with bdsm or even being a control freak. control, domination and power can come in many levels. it is a matter of what you want out of your own life and using what you are comfortable with.  all in all, be yourself!according to most sitcoms that i watch... yes. we are entering a world dominated by women. or are as my nerdy half cousin would call it: ""we are about to interface with theorifice of a matriarchtical society, flamen!""all of this shit is funny.personally? i think everything is based on personal merit.  i've come up against several men of power in my life who are inherently sexist, but i have never failed to get what i wanted because i never let them regard me in a lower way. i think if you have enough respect for yourself and a general air of confidence, you can get most things done.  this is probably because i grew up training horses with guys though. you can whine, bitch, and moan.  i think women are definitely at a disadvantage because there is a high percentage who rely on being cute to get their way... which can work to an extent, but not in a way which will earn you any kind of respect in the future. more likely a pat on the head and a send her on her way.soooo how the hell does that put other women at a disadvantage?lol..don't even answer.haha, i will answer.  because, if some chick screws her boss to get a raise, how much respect is there in that? she's basically a whore.  that's an extreme example, but generally the meaning is the same. i don't respect girls who use their looks to get what they want in the work place.key phrase:""she's basically a whore.""  ...that's what i'm saying. there's no respect in that relationship. so how can they be equal?"

0,"so why is lady derotshchild so concered about the dems losing the election if her nephew philip is pushing mccain? is there a split between her husband evelyn rothschild and his brother jacob, whose son hosted a fundraiser for john mccain?if u have billions of dollars, u buy both candidates --what's a couple million when u have billions (thousands of millions)the rothschild family has allegedly been highly involved on both ends of the political spectrum for hundreds of years and have even allegedly been involved in coercion of markets through media and black-ops along with jp morgan interests and the rockefellers.  those are three families that the fringe conspiracy research community have addressed for decades. it's just strange how bearn stearns collapses and is eaten up by jp morgan chase (formerly run by david rockefeller) last fall and now the rothschilds are very publicly pushing the one party system, masquerading as two.  the 'conspiracy theorists' are gaining more validity by the day.she must have huge balls, and should be pushing a wheel barrow to accuse obama of being an elitest ,, i sat back and laughed that she dare say this with a straight face. who's kidding who, she would change parties to support the candidate that can be influenced to support an attack on iran,, that must mean she thinks mccain will do it while obama will use diplomacy.the rothschilds literally bank the intellectual laziness of the american people.she is helping the obama campaign by making such nonsensical comments and will people will look at her as they do mccain , he doesnt know how many houses he owns, with a wife worth a fortune, how she understand what the middle class is suffering and call obama an ""elitest"".what difference does it make? u conspiracy theorist believe everyone in government is part of nwo. mccain, obama, or clinton what's the point of this. its all the same conclusion. world domination.no eddie, i don't believe they're in control of every candidate. they're an interlocking group at bilderberg. it's not all one big conspiracy. there are circles of influence and infighting, i'm sure.  it's not difficult at all to trace the clintons, bushes, mccains, bidens and obamas of the world to mega powerful corporations whose vice-presidents and board members meet with agents of the two parties at various forums and conferences, bilderberg being one of them. it's a revolving door of private finance and corporate and state alliances that border on fascism. when each candidate is only a degree or two removed from each other through influence peddlers who've traveled back and forth between the political and financial world and can be documented as to making a killing off the post-9/11 thiefdom economy, you've got a problem.  it's not so easily though, to connect ron paul (republican), ralph nader (independent), cynthia mckinney (green) and bob barr (libertarian) to the same network of iraq war marketers and opportunists.well nate think of it this way. the european banking cartels have been finacing both sides of every war for 200+ years. there is where you should look.  or here. kinds of a funny about the fed.   http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26754130the house of rothschild was worth billions well over a century ago. today they are likely to be worth hundreds of trillions of dollars.    this book by dr. john coleman, author of the committee of 300, tells how mayer amschel, the founder of the red shield dynasty, acquired his first fortune. it is a far cry from the myths and legends that still surround the man who began as a rag and bone merchant and pawnbroker, working out of a small house on judenstrasse, frankfurt on the main, germany, where he lived with his wife and family. the events attributed to history are often caused by a hidden hand pulling the strings of kings, emperors, princes and potentates from behind the scenes. this phenomenon is explained, and the legends that have grown up around the rothschilds are demolished by this book that also reveals the rothschilds intriguing that brought down men like napoleon and tsar alexander ii of russia. legend has it that mayer amschel rothschilds genius and financial skills were inherited by his sons, but the truth is quite a different story, as dr. coleman makes very clear in this well documented account that goes far beyond the best known legends cloaking the true character of the family. exactly how mayer amschel rothschild struck it lucky and the steps he took that brought the family from obscurity to virtual rulers of all europe, makes fascinating reading. this outstanding book is not only about the past, it is also about the present and the future. it will help to explain many of the events that perplex the ordinary people like the war in iraq and the war threats against iran."

0,"i hope not. it's a great game and all,but i'd rather see a movie based on something after rotj. enough of the clone wars and anything between the existing movies. give us something new for a change.oh god! no more fucking star wars, please..(!)i think it'll never happen.i know, seriously! and this is coming from a huge star wars fan too. i'm starting to get pretty sick of it.well george lucas swore that there would never be an epsiode 7,8 and 9 and concidering that mark hamill is old now just leaves out the possibility right there as well. reason i think the force unleashed would work is because the story is right there. the story is actually in between the episodes and is explained well on what happened to the jedi and who finished them off.  i beaten the game and do believe that alot of the segments would work well in the movie. the part where the secret apprentice takes down a star destroyer with his force powers would deffinitally work well in the film as so would his fights against the jedi he was tasked to kill. also the ending sequence would most certainly make the film as well if it does happen.  i still have yet to see the clone wars movie and tv show and am awaiting the live action bounty hunter series due in 2011 but if there is any true star wars film to be made it would have to be the force unleashed in my own opinion.star wars should be left alone, unless it's knights of the old republic and has nothing to do with lucas. i'm sick of lucas raping stormtroopers and spitting in the face of fans.i will admit i would love to see a kotor movie but it will not happen until george lucas sells his rights. i will also go on to admit that epsidoe 1 n 2 were not so impressive and thankfully epsiode 3 was the best in the prequels. the fact episode 3 took a darker turn was the best choice for the final installment. also it isn't george lycas' fault he cannot direct anymore. before agreeing to write/direct episode 1,2 and 3, george lucas hasn't directed since episode 4 which was released in 1977.  after epsidoe 4 he just produced the indiana jones trilogy and along with star wars episode 5 and 6. it was a shame that episode 1 n 2 weren't that good but at least they were decent. i still have yet to see the clone wars show so there is no telling if george lucas gotten worse or a tad bit better.  anyhow i personally think a force unleashed film would work if handled rightthe prequels being 3 of the worst movies is hardly a secret.the only redeeming quality of the three were qui-gon jinn and darth maul, and in typical lucas fashion he took the only good things in the films and killed them. hayden christensen's acting is on par with keanu reeves, but considering the ep 1-3 held little continuity to the original 3, i guess his horrible acting falls short of being the top reason things went wrong.hayden christensen was likely the worst cast for anakin sykwalker. i figured either george lucas either wanted a bargain bin actor or he just couldn't find anyone else to replace him. i remembered after episode 2 came into theaters it was rumored that hugh jackman was to take over the role of anakin sykwalker. reason that was the rumor was because it was said at the time that episode 3 would take place a big amount of years after episode 2.  it was right when episode 3 went into production that everyone around saw that the rumor was false and hayden was back.i personally liked episode 3 alot and did appreciate alot of the things in it. i liked the entire beginning with the battle over coruscant took place which lead to the duel between anakin and count dooku.  i also liked how the emperor held a lightsaber and did combat with yoda and also the whole battle sequence between general grievous and obi wan was surely entertaining. i liked episode 3 and it would be entertaining to see the force unleashed turned into a film. if it is written well and has a good director on board i would be satisfied.  if the force unleashed is turned into a film i would highly doubt george lucas would direct. he would most likely co write and probably produce. the least star wars brand he would direct would be some of the episodes on the upcoming live action tv show due in late 2011.ok one force unleashed wouldn't work...  why because dath vader is best left where he is and also where the fuck would this new apprentice fit into the whole saga without being mentioned in episode 4 - 6. because remember that force unleashed is set during the time span of 3 - 4. what happen inbetween that big gap in the saga. its best left as a game and nothing more. and come on can they really find anyone else to do darth vader.   kotor has acctually been in discussion and george lucas apparently expressed interested in the project as a motion picture film in 2 films, after he completed episode iii. but lucas then decided to cancel and wipe away the idea and revealed that the ideas he had written and expressed down that would have appeared in the two kotor movies, will now appear some where in the anticipated live action star wars series, which may never come, since its been in pre-production god knows how long"

1,"viva la resisistance(but4real this time dude) body: is it time for a rebellion? october 20, 2008 ""50 percent no and 50 percent hell no!""--rep. jim moran (d-va. ) on feedback received from his constituents regarding congress' bailout package mere days after president bush signed into law an $810 billion bailout bill aimed at rescuing the wall street financiers, one of the recipients, american international group inc., threw a $440,000 bash for its executives at a swanky resort, complete with spa treatments, banquets and golf outings. at the same time that aig execs were celebrating lavishly, indirectly at taxpayer expense, nearly 12 million american taxpayers, who owed more on their mortgages than their homes are worth, were in danger of foreclosure. as if it weren't bad enough that a fiscally irresponsible corporate america is going to be bailed out at taxpayer expense, congress included more than $100 billion in pork barrel projects in the bill. nothing short of congressional bribes, these so-called inducements range from an exemption from excise tax for wooden arrows designed for use by children and tax write-offs for motorsports racing track facility owners to tax rebates on rum imported from puerto rico and the virgin islands, as well as imported wool. this is not relief, it is economic slavery. it has become increasingly clear that the greatest threat to our freedoms--and our bank accounts--does not lurk outside our borders. rather, it prowls among us, in the form of a government of wolves that is running wild and riding roughshod over our freedoms. there was a time when such a blatant disregard for the burden being laid upon the american taxpayer would have elicited howls of outrage, protest marches and perhaps even outright rebellion. today, however, many americans understandably feel helpless to do anything about their plight. after all, despite the fact that calls and emails to congressional offices were overwhelmingly against the $810 billion pork-laden bailout, the legislation passed anyway. yet consider this: at its core, the quest for the american dream is about gaining sovereignty over one's life and property. without it, there can be no freedom. while we have become accustomed to equating property with land ownership, the term is much more fundamental and personal. it refers to a kind of sovereignty over one's life and possessions--especially one's money. questions about who has ultimate control over our money, how much of it can be claimed by government and how it gets spent go to the heart of the battle over property rights. governments generate no wealth on their own. any resources that they have at their disposal have been appropriated from the original producers of that wealth, the citizens. this fundamental truth has largely been forgotten over the years. yet the government's respect for and treatment of the property of its citizens often reflects its attitude regarding its citizens' rights as a whole. conversely, a government that doesn't respect the rights of its citizens will have even less regard for their property--be it land, money or personhood. with the wall street bailout, the president and congress simply disregarded the clear will of the people. and while secret agreements were obviously made and backroom bargains struck, the constitution and our rights were not even given a second thought. however, those who wrote the constitution drafted our founding document with the intention of ensuring that the power of government remained with the people. the framers wanted citizens to know what the government is doing and how it spends taxpayer funds. and if the elected officials aren't doing their jobs or the people disagreed with their performance, the framers empowered the people to unseat their representatives. without these safeguards, there is no representative government. since the country's inception, america has been synonymous with the concept that there are certain individual rights and freedoms that no one, not even government agents, can violate. as the declaration of independence boldly proclaims: ""we hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. "" these were revolutionary ideas in an age of kings and serfdoms, and they served as a springboard for the constitution and the bill of rights. these rights were considered absolute and so precious that no government can violate them. and the early american colonists believed these principles were not only worth fighting for, they were worth dying for. one of these was the right of the people to change or do away with a government that attempts to undermine their rights. as the declaration concludes, ""whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. "" governments are brought into being to protect our rights. when they systematically violate them, the people have a right--nay, a duty--to resist. this was the true spirit of 1776 that moved the american colonists to start a revolution against a government that was violating their rights. this willingness to stand and fight against corrupt government was what it meant to be an american in our nation's early years. and if we truly want to be americans today, it will mean practicing every form of nonviolent resistance available to us as citizens--including picketing, mass protests, sit-ins, boycotts and so on. it will certainly take more than voting for or against a particular politician. thomas jefferson was right: ""what country can preserve its liberties, if its rulers are not warned from time to time, that this people preserve the spirit of resistance?"" available online at: http://www. rutherford. org/articles_db/commentary. asp?record_id=559 exactly dude thats what i been tripping on for to long!! we have to take action its getting worse all the time!!! any ideas for putting together a meeting of some sort? maybe finding hella people who see it like that too so we can all change this country back to what we were supposed to stand up for, so we represent and stand for what we were meant to stand up for. how often are elections started with an idea that we, the actual people, has decided? we are brain washed into believing we are making the important decisions when in all actualites they,[the ""president""(our king) and his noble mary men(the government end elected political officials] give us preselected canidates to vote on so ""we"" choose witch of the presented options they give us. so they this play mind-fuck game where people truely do believe we as the worlds free people are together deciding through this little""what do u wanna do huny? u decide""ol' trick: much like a parent gives a child, you can pick!! a., b., c., or d. its your decision you pick... without telling anyone: not even in fine print, but if u read between the lines it clearly is almost like saying ya go ahead and vote for whomever you want but they just cant say that or the mindpower/control will be lost. they have sooo many distractions to keep us all happy and busy and do just what they want. they very treat us like we are all individual crazy/guilty persons while the finger remains pointed at us for fear we may turn it around they create laws to keep the majority of us behind bars or hiding indoors for fear of police whom intarigate, harrass and search with no warning at any time for whatever reasons they make up. the country we live in today is not close to what it was created for nor anywhere near compariable to what our founding fathers intended this place to be like. it is almost as if we are commited to kings and its 16th century london but only with technology, womens rights and a grip more rules to follow. emily: it seems like people r 2 rapped up n their own lives to pay attention or even fight whats going on. people r scared to lose their jobs. so many people, r concerned about irrelevant things. so, when u think u found others whom u could join and get some type of march going, they throw in unrelated issues like abortion or whose gonna win the election. we needed to stop this before the election, by the time the election come whats done is done that is true but we as the people need to put a stop to the madness we need to stand together they need us like we need them.damn girl you just killed my eyeswsdfjneurovbnerpivijervnerovohjewrvnrnrvrejfirjverpipverk;gjsrs;

0,"michele bachmann's rival reaps benefits of her 'hardball' comments la times, 10/23/08  by p.j. huffstutter  reporting from blaine, minn.  elwyn tinklenberg is living the long-shot candidate's political dream.  there weren't enough chairs for the volunteers crammed inside the four-room campaign office wednesday morning. every time aides hit ""refresh"" on their computers, hundreds more online donations appeared. downstairs, the postal carrier spent 10 minutes trying to cram a two-foot stack of envelopes stuffed with checks into the mail slot.  ""it's been raining money,"" said beth deziel, 39, the campaign's dazed deputy finance director. ""there's so much, we can barely keep up. it's unbelievable.""  but this unsolicited good fortune -- $1.3 million since friday -- isn't based on anything the democratic former mayor and grandfather of seven did. it's all because of something his rival, minnesota rep. michele bachmann, said.  on friday afternoon, bachmann appeared on msnbc's ""hardball with chris matthews"" and made what has been dubbed the million-dollar mistake: bachmann, 52, alleged that presidential candidate barack obama may hold ""anti-american"" views, and proposed a media investigation into ""the views of the people in congress [to] find out: are they pro-america or anti-america?""  while sen. obama's presidential bid has transformed the way campaigns use the internet to reach volunteers and donors, the technology has also become a way for the public to instantly react -- even to races in which they can't vote.  those quick reactions, often in the form of donations, can influence the outcome of a campaign, said julie barko germany, director of the institute for politics, democracy & the internet at george washington university's graduate school of political management.  barko german said ""the internet can be an amplifier,"" enabling viewers to react instantly to something that incites strong support or fury.  ""it's an excellent fundraising tool,"" she added, citing research indicating that ""when you show someone a video online, they donate 10% more.""  bachmann's interview has turned the race into one of the country's most intensely watched. it also unleashed an online backlash against bachmann, who many local political observers assumed would easily win reelection.  president bush won the district in 2004 with 57% of the vote. in 2006, former state sen. bachmann was heralded as the first female republican to be elected to the u.s. house of representatives from the district, which is dominated by blue-collar and farming communities.  and this summer, one of the few polls conducted in the race showed that bachmann held a 13-point lead over tinklenberg.  but on wednesday, the national republican congressional committee pulled all of its tv advertising supporting bachmann in the 6th district, according to a gop source. since her ""hardball"" appearance, bachmann's lawn signs have been vandalized. callers spew profanity at volunteers and obscenities about the congresswoman at her district campaign office.  bachmann has retreated from her statements at nearly every campaign stop. she blamed the brouhaha on falling into a ""trap"" she said matthews laid for her, and on having her words twisted by bloggers.  ""this has been a game of telephone gone into overdrive -- nothing more,"" said bachmann spokeswoman michelle marston. ""a week ago, our competitor had no name identification. if they think that they'll win by throwing a million dollars worth of mud, i can tell you right now it won't be enough.""  marston said bachmann's campaign also had seen a jump in contributions, from sympathetic donors who feel she's being unfairly targeted. but marston said she didn't know the specific amount.  at the time bachmann was on ""hardball,"" tinklenberg was watching a college hockey game and stumping for votes in the bleachers. the cheers drowned out the sound of his cellphone ringing.  ""by the time i looked at it, my voice mail was full,"" said tinklenberg, 58, who served as gov. jesse ventura's transportation commissioner from 1999 to 2002 and now works as a transportation consultant.  ""it was family, friends, neighbors, supporters,"" tinklenberg said. ""everyone was asking, 'did you see what she said?' ""  since then, the campaign -- whose eight staff members had gone dumpster-diving for office furniture and the wire wickets used for lawn signs -- has become flush.  the majority of the funds have come electronically. of the more than 20,000 online donations, 3,210 came from minnesota. an additional 2,405 people donated from california, and 2,330 from texas.  thousands of people have called the campaign office, offering up their credit card numbers. some gave the maximum $2,300, but most offered far smaller amounts, $3 or $5, along with a message of support and an apology for not being able to give more.  ""i'm a registered republican and i have never made contributions to political campaigns,"" wrote one 66-year-old donor. ""i wish i could send more."" in a greeting card with a fuzzy white kitten on the front, another donor wrote, ""what your opponent said on chris matthews was sickening! hope you can defeat her!""  people who said they couldn't afford to give cash have been dropping off food for tinklenberg and the staff -- platters of apple strudel, pots of chicken noodle soup, paper bags stuffed with oatmeal cookies.  now, tinklenberg said, the campaign is trying to find ways to spend so much money in so little time, so he can get out his message on ways to attract jobs, improve public infrastructure and expand public transportation options. his staff is frantically contacting local tv and radio stations to snap up available advertisement spots, installing more phone lines and placing orders for stacks of boxes of campaign literature.  ""i'm not happy she said what she said,"" tinklenberg said. ""but we certainly are benefiting from it.""  huffstutter is a times staff writer.  ------------------------------------------     here is the anti-american tinklenberg's website where you can give til' it hurts.   hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!!!!!!   if tinklenberg wins, i will be gloating for years.i don't care how often i have to shamelessly bump this this weekend.  this is too important not to be on the front page.  go elwyn!!!here is what she actually said.  since then the gop has yanked ads in her district, the dems have thrown in $1million in advertising on top of all the cash this guy has gotten directly.it is a sad day to see that joe mccarthy's heirs are still around.  and from the same area too.he raised $1,000,000 or so in a the last year before thursday of last week.  he has since raised $1,200,000 in one week, more than his incumbent opponent.that's me baby.  f*** yeah.everybody sing it with me...""amuricahhhh...fuck yeah !!""heh, i posted this on the obama national website too. got at least one other person to donate.  i'm pumped.wow! there are over 2,000 of you?are you pumped because he nails talking points so well...or that it will be at least a month before he becomes a typical member of congress?"

0,"several mccain advisers suggested that they have become increasingly frustrated with what one aide described as palin ""going rogue.""she's a maverick.   *wink*i love this line in the article:  ""a palin aide, however, told cnn that the governor clearly felt like she had to say something to defend herself, because ""that's really not who she is.""    what's that old saying? if it walks like a duck.....   i don't care that the rnc paid for the wardrobe and it was not illegal. i find it excessive and wasteful. furthermore; her attempt(s) to justify it are lame.it is possible that palin's strengths as a personality were not capitalized properly by the mccain campaign. her expensive makeover, for example, might not have been so radically necessary if the idea were to push the hockey mom image more.  but i think there are some pretty obvious reasons why the campaign wants to control palin rather tightly. upon introduction of palin, the talk was as if obama and palin were the ones directly contesting for office.  this obviously would be damaging to mccain so you would have to think that mccain's advisers would want to redirect the focus on the main candidate and, also, bring palin under wing in terms of talking points ... the way that the mccain advisers see the issues to be.  rollins refers to the problem as mishandling palin which does not underscore whether he saw palin as an asset for substantive issues.  bill kristol, an early and still vocal champion of palin feels that she should have been let loose to just speak her mind ... within bounds, presumably.  either way, her role was to keep the hopes of a major bop base alive and active and she has done that.  that there are gop opinion leaders that have moved away from the campaign to support obama isn't simply a matter of palin having been mishandled, imo.personally, i rather think that, like it or not, if one is voting for mccain for potus, one is also, essentially, voting for palin for the same office, at some point. 72 is a seasoned age, and it could be argued that the john mccain of 72 is far from the john mccain of 64. at any rate, the chances of palin stepping into the position some time in the next 4 years is significant.  that having been said, this is the woman who flatly stated that the vpotus runs the senate, and can really get in there and mix it up and change things with the senators.  *shudder*like i said before. get a time machine and bring mccain 00 back from the past to beat the snot out of mccain 08.qft.oh, from the outside looking in, you're right.  but from inside the mccain campaign ... the notion that a candidate runs with a verity that he may die due to his age and health in office isn't in the playbook. so it is mccain first, palin second and only in a supporting role.  palin stealing headlines from obama is one thing but also pushing mccain off the headlines is not acceptable.  it was important to get the base back with him because his position with them hasn't always been a totally warm and fuzzy experience. palin was the answer, it seems. the question really is, though, how big is that base today compared to previous elections?  vocal, the base may be but how many are still in that base? i have my doubts that it is as big as it once was. it is still sizable and mccain needs them to have a prayer of chance of winning but i am a little skeptical about its current size partly because of palin and what her stronpoints at re-activating that base happen to be.good point, as always, old friend.well i think they tried that and every time she did, she got hung. to many big words for her."

0,"hi! can somebody pls give me any science fair idea for high school? ppplllleeeeaaaassssseee!!!! i badly need it right now! thanks!here is one¦prove that past present and further dont really exists, that the perception of time is simply just conciseness, ability to process information and memory.this is a rather fun one that i always wanted to do. even though most winners at science fairs are biology projects this one is still way cool and is a physics one.    you measure the speed of light. here is what you need a microwave (without the automatic turn table), some chocolate or cheese, an accurate ruler (measurements in milimeters), a plate.    what you do is break up the cheese or chacolate and spread it up along the plate. put it in the microwave and turn it on... observe it and wait for small parts of it to melt. this phenomina happens because the microwaves which are inside your microwave oven form a standing wave. this is why you have to stir food in it to cook it or have a turn table, or have you ever noticed how one bit will be real hot, and then the bite right next to it will be ice cold? the goal is to let it form a few hot spots that melt the cheese in those places. then you want to take a ruler and measure the distance between each of the hotspots. you now know the wavelength of microwaves, it will be best to convert this length into meters (it will be like .005 meters or something like that though) . now to figure out the speed of light    c = speed of light (electromagnetic radiation)  l = wavelength of the light  f = frequency of the light    the equation is as follows    c = l*f    you measured l, now to get f, look on the back of the microwave and look for the frequency of the waves. it will probably be in mhz or something like that (i don't remember the frequencies of microwaves off the top of my head). mulitply l times f and you have just figured out the speed of light!hey, that's supposed to be a riddle! don't give it away      anyhow, you want some fun stuff, there's all kinds of stuff. you could make a tesla coil or vand de graff machine. those are funduckweed. use duckweed. it produces a shitload of protein . i did something about the effects of different fertilizers (including guppy poop...ever try to figure out the nitrogen composition of guppy shit?). it would be interesting to see how different growing conditions influence protein production, or find the optimum condition for protein production in a natural setting and try to increase it. ph, temperature, light access, etc."
0,"well it depends, pretty much a combination of both. if you major in psychology at a major party school compared to an ivy league school, then your chances of making more money lessen. it also depends on what major you plan on going into. if your school is reputable for whatever major you want to pursue then yea go for it.i think its the school, because its the school that provides you the enviornment where you can network and get your contacts established, which leads to job oppurtunities.both are important, but i think the major is even more so... depends on what jobs are available what is needed, if a teacher is needed they are going to look for a teacher, historian they will look for a history major... it all goes, there is less you can do wiith a communications degree then you can do with an education degreedoes it rally matter? i dont really care how much i get paid, as long as its enough to live off of n stuff,,, my school is teaching me how to do the job i wanna do very well,,, what more could i ask for? :)if you were an employer and had two people applying for a job; one from dartmouth and one from devry; who would you rather have?journalism/chicano studies is my major..i saw its a combo of both really.the right majorthe right school. most people don't even have a job that has to do with their major or degree..the right degree and the right university and good results...oh and good practical experience!!!"
